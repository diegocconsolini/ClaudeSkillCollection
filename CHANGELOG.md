## Version History

### Version Numbering

We use Semantic Versioning (SemVer):
- **MAJOR** version for incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version for new functionality (backward compatible)
- **PATCH** version for backward compatible bug fixes

### Skill Versioning

Each skill maintains its own version:
- Repository version: Overall collection version
- Skill version: Individual skill version
- Both follow SemVer independently

Example:
- Repository: v2.0.0 (added 5 new skills)
- GDPR Auditor: v1.2.0 (minor updates)
