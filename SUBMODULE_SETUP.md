# Private Submodule Setup Summary

**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Date:** 2025-10-19
**Private Repo:** https://github.com/diegocconsolini/ClaudeSkillCollection-Private

## What Was Created

### 1. Private Repository ✅

**Repository:** `ClaudeSkillCollection-Private`
- **URL:** https://github.com/diegocconsolini/ClaudeSkillCollection-Private
- **Visibility:** Private (only you and invited collaborators can access)
- **Location:** `/Users/diegocavalariconsolini/ClaudeCode/ClaudeSkillCollection-Private`

**Structure:**
```
ClaudeSkillCollection-Private/
├── README.md          # Repository documentation
├── .gitignore         # Security rules
├── drafts/            # Draft documentation
├── research/          # Research materials
├── wip-plugins/       # Work-in-progress plugins
├── test-data/         # Test datasets
└── notes/             # Development notes
```

### 2. Submodule Integration ✅

**Added to Main Repository:**
- `.gitmodules` file created
- `private/` directory linked as submodule
- Points to: https://github.com/diegocconsolini/ClaudeSkillCollection-Private.git

**How It Works:**
- Public repo shows `private/` folder reference
- Public visitors **cannot access** the private repo contents
- Only authenticated users with permissions can clone and access

---

## How to Use

### Working in Private Repository

**Navigate to private workspace:**
```bash
cd ClaudeSkillCollection/private/
```

**Create work-in-progress plugin:**
```bash
cd private/wip-plugins/
mkdir ccpa-auditor
cd ccpa-auditor

# Work on the plugin...
# When ready:
git add .
git commit -m "Add CCPA auditor draft"
git push
```

**Add research materials:**
```bash
cd private/research/
# Add files...
git add .
git commit -m "Add CCPA legal references"
git push
```

**Development notes:**
```bash
cd private/notes/
echo "TODO: Implement HIPAA scanner" > roadmap.md
git add roadmap.md
git commit -m "Add development roadmap"
git push
```

### Syncing Changes

**When you update the private repo, update the main repo reference:**
```bash
# In main repository
cd ClaudeSkillCollection
git add private/
git commit -m "Update private submodule reference"
git push
```

### Moving Plugin to Public

**When a plugin is ready for release:**

```bash
# 1. Copy from private to public
cp -r private/wip-plugins/ccpa-auditor ./ccpa-auditor

# 2. Update marketplace.json
# Add plugin entry to .claude-plugin/marketplace.json

# 3. Commit to public repository
git add ccpa-auditor/
git add .claude-plugin/marketplace.json
git commit -m "Add CCPA Auditor plugin v1.0.0"
git push

# 4. Optionally remove from private (or keep as backup)
cd private/wip-plugins/
rm -rf ccpa-auditor
git add .
git commit -m "Moved CCPA auditor to public release"
git push
```

## For Collaborators

### If You Invite Collaborators

**Give them access to the private repo:**
1. Go to https://github.com/diegocconsolini/ClaudeSkillCollection-Private/settings/access
2. Click "Add people"
3. Enter their GitHub username
4. Choose permission level (Write or Admin)

**They can then clone with submodule:**
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/diegocconsolini/ClaudeSkillCollection.git
cd ClaudeSkillCollection/private/
# They now have access to private workspace
```

---

## For Public Users

### What Public Users See

When someone visits your public repository:
- ✅ They see the marketplace and public plugins
- ✅ They see there is a `private/` directory
- ❌ They **cannot** access the private directory contents
- ❌ They **cannot** clone the private submodule

**Example when they try to clone:**
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/diegocconsolini/ClaudeSkillCollection.git
# Output: Warning: failed to clone 'private' (Permission denied)
# Everything else clones fine, just not the private submodule
```

---

## Git Commands Reference

### Common Operations

**Check submodule status:**
```bash
git submodule status
```

**Update submodule to latest:**
```bash
cd private/
git pull origin main
cd ..
git add private/
git commit -m "Update private submodule to latest"
```

**Work in private repo:**
```bash
cd private/
# Normal git operations
git add .
git commit -m "Message"
git push
```

**Update main repo to track changes:**
```bash
cd ClaudeSkillCollection
git add private/
git commit -m "Update private submodule reference"
git push
```

## File Organization Best Practices

### What Goes in Private Repo

✅ **Good for Private:**
- Work-in-progress plugins (not production-ready)
- Draft documentation
- Research materials
- Experimental features
- Development notes and planning
- Test data (sanitized, non-sensitive)
- Ideas and brainstorming

❌ **Should NOT go in Private Repo:**
- API keys or credentials (use environment variables)
- Sensitive user data
- Production secrets
- Personally identifiable information

❌ **Never Commit:**
- `.env` files (already in .gitignore)
- `credentials/` directory (already in .gitignore)
- Actual secrets or passwords

### When to Move to Public

Move plugins from `private/` to public when:
- ✅ Plugin is production-ready
- ✅ Tested on real-world applications
- ✅ Documentation is complete
- ✅ No security vulnerabilities
- ✅ Follows quality standards
- ✅ References verified against authoritative sources

---

## Backup Strategy

**Private repo is backed up to GitHub:**
- ✅ Automatically synced when you push
- ✅ Version history preserved
- ✅ Can restore from any commit
- ✅ Protected by GitHub's infrastructure

**Local backup:**
```bash
# Optionally create local backup
cd /Users/diegocavalariconsolini/ClaudeCode
tar -czf ClaudeSkillCollection-Private-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz ClaudeSkillCollection-Private/
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Submodule shows as modified

**Cause:** Private repo has uncommitted changes

**Solution:**
```bash
cd private/
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Save changes"
git push
```

### Issue: Can't push to private repo

**Cause:** Authentication issue

**Solution:**
```bash
cd private/
git remote -v
# Should show HTTPS URL
# Authenticate with GitHub CLI: gh auth login
```

### Issue: Submodule not cloning

**Cause:** Don't have access to private repo

**Solution:**
- This is expected for public users
- Only you and invited collaborators can access
- Clone public repo without `--recurse-submodules` flag

---

## Current Status

### Files Staged for Commit

In main repository:
```
Changes to be committed:
  new file:   .gitmodules
  new file:   private

Untracked files (marketplace features):
  .claude-plugin/marketplace.json
  MARKETPLACE.md
  MARKETPLACE_IMPLEMENTATION.md
  gdpr-auditor/plugin.json
  docs/claude-code-marketplaces-complete-list.md

Modified files:
  CHANGELOG.md
  README.md
```

### Next Steps

1. **Commit all marketplace + submodule changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add marketplace support and private development workspace"
   git push
   ```

2. **Start using private workspace:**
   ```bash
   cd private/wip-plugins/
   # Start working on next plugin
   ```

## Security Notes

### Private Repository Settings

**Already configured:**
- ✅ Repository is private
- ✅ Only you have access
- ✅ HTTPS authentication required
- ✅ .gitignore protects sensitive files

**Recommendations:**
- Enable 2FA on GitHub account
- Use SSH keys for authentication (optional)
- Regularly review access permissions
- Never commit real credentials (use .env files)

### What Public Users Can/Cannot See

**Public users CAN see:**
- Public marketplace and plugins
- That a private submodule exists
- The submodule path (`private/`)

**Public users CANNOT see:**
- Contents of private repository
- File names in private repo
- Any code or documentation in private workspace
- Commit history of private repo

---

## Summary

✅ **Created:** Private repository at https://github.com/diegocconsolini/ClaudeSkillCollection-Private
✅ **Configured:** Git submodule in main repository
✅ **Documented:** README in both repos
✅ **Organized:** Folder structure for development workflow
✅ **Secured:** Private visibility, .gitignore rules

**You can now:**
- Work on plugins privately before release
- Keep research and notes synced to GitHub
- Maintain a clean public repository
- Control what gets published
