## üìê Skill Design Principles

**Core Philosophy:** Claude skills are designed to help Claude **generate deliverables**, not to perform live analysis or real-time monitoring.

### ‚úÖ Claude Skills ARE:

- **Document Generators** - Create specific file types (reports, configs, documentation)
- **Workflow Guides** - Step-by-step instructions for systematic tasks
- **Template Systems** - Reusable patterns and boilerplates
- **Format Converters** - Transform data into structured deliverables
- **Code Libraries** - Manipulate file structures and generate code

**Examples:**
- ‚úÖ GDPR Auditor: Guides Claude to generate compliance reports by analyzing code
- ‚úÖ Privacy Policy Generator: Creates policy documents from data practices
- ‚úÖ Security Checklist: Produces security assessment checklists

### ‚ùå Claude Skills are NOT:

- **Analysis Tools** - That scan live systems or running applications
- **External Services** - That require APIs or third-party integrations
- **Real-time Monitors** - That need continuous data streams
- **Subjective Assessors** - That make judgments without clear criteria
- **Simple Calculators** - That just return a single number

**Anti-patterns:**
- ‚ùå "Live vulnerability scanner" - Requires real-time system access
- ‚ùå "API health monitor" - Needs continuous external service calls
- ‚ùå "Performance analyzer" - Requires runtime metrics
- ‚ùå "Code quality scorer" - Too subjective without clear deliverable

### Design Guidelines

**When creating a skill, ask:**

1. **Does it produce a tangible deliverable?** (report, document, config file, etc.)
2. **Can it work with static code/files?** (no live system access required)
3. **Does it follow a systematic workflow?** (clear step-by-step process)
4. **Is it based on objective criteria?** (regulations, standards, best practices)
5. **Does it include reference materials?** (authoritative sources, templates)

**Good Skill Pattern:**
```
Input: Codebase files, configuration files, documentation
Process: Systematic analysis using reference materials
Output: Structured report/document/checklist with specific findings
```

## üîí Private Development Workspace

This repository includes a **private submodule** for work-in-progress plugins and development materials.

### What's in `private/`?

The `private/` directory is a **git submodule** pointing to a separate private repository:
- **Repository:** [ClaudeSkillCollection-Private](https://github.com/diegocconsolini/ClaudeSkillCollection-Private) (private)
- **Purpose:** Development workspace for unreleased plugins
- **Access:** Repository owner and invited collaborators only

**Contents:**
- `drafts/` - Draft documentation and ideas
- `research/` - Research materials and references
- `wip-plugins/` - Work-in-progress plugins (not ready for release)
- `test-data/` - Test datasets (sanitized)
- `notes/` - Development notes and planning

### How to Access (For Collaborators)

If you have access to the private repository:

```bash
# Clone with submodule
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/diegocconsolini/ClaudeSkillCollection.git

# Or if already cloned
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

### For Public Users

Public visitors will see the `private/` submodule reference in the repository, but **cannot access** the contents. This is intentional - it allows development work to happen privately before plugins are ready for public release.

## How Skills Work

Claude Code skills are specialized prompts with supporting materials that give Claude domain expertise. When you invoke a skill:

1. **Automatic Loading:** Mention the skill's domain (e.g., "GDPR compliance") or explicitly call it
2. **Context Injection:** Claude loads the skill's knowledge and workflow instructions
3. **Tool Access:** Claude can use skill-specific scripts and reference materials
4. **Guided Workflow:** Claude follows the skill's methodology for thorough analysis

### Example: GDPR Auditor Workflow

```
User: "Audit my app for GDPR compliance"
  ‚Üì
Claude loads gdpr-auditor skill
  ‚Üì
Skill guides Claude through:
  1. Identify scope and data types
  2. Run automated scanners
  3. Consult GDPR reference materials
  4. Analyze code and configurations
  5. Generate compliance report
  ‚Üì
Professional audit report with specific findings
```
