# Plugin Location Fix - CRITICAL

**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Issue**: Plugin was not loading in Claude Code sessions
**Status**: âœ… FIXED

---

## Root Cause

The plugin was located in the **WRONG directory**:

**Before (WRONG)**:
```
/Users/diegocavalariconsolini/ClaudeCode/ClaudeSkillCollection-Private/wip-plugins/incident-response-playbook-creator/
```

**After (CORRECT)**:
```
/Users/diegocavalariconsolini/ClaudeCode/ClaudeSkillCollection/private/wip-plugins/incident-response-playbook-creator/
```

---

## Why This Matters

Claude Code scans for plugins in the **main `ClaudeSkillCollection/` directory**, not in `ClaudeSkillCollection-Private/`.

Working plugins are located at:
- âœ… `ClaudeSkillCollection/gdpr-auditor/` (production)
- âœ… `ClaudeSkillCollection/cybersecurity-policy-generator/` (production)
- âœ… `ClaudeSkillCollection/private/wip-plugins/` (work-in-progress)

The plugin was in a completely separate repository (`ClaudeSkillCollection-Private`) which Claude Code doesn't scan.

## Fixes Applied

### Fix #1: Plugin Location (CRITICAL)
- âœ… Copied plugin from `ClaudeSkillCollection-Private/wip-plugins/`
- âœ… To `ClaudeSkillCollection/private/wip-plugins/`
- âœ… Plugin is now in the directory Claude Code scans

### Fix #2: Plugin Structure
- âœ… Changed `main_skill: "SKILL.md"` to `agents` array
- âœ… Added `$schema` reference
- âœ… Added `homepage` and `repository` metadata
- âœ… Matches structure of working plugins (gdpr-auditor)

## How to Test

**You MUST test in a FRESH Claude Code session** (not this one):

1. Open a **new** Claude Code session
2. Type: `Create an incident response playbook for ransomware attacks`
3. Expected: Plugin auto-loads and AskUserQuestion appears

---

## Plugin Now Located At

```
/Users/diegocavalariconsolini/ClaudeCode/ClaudeSkillCollection/private/wip-plugins/incident-response-playbook-creator/
```

All files copied successfully:
- âœ… plugin.json (with correct structure)
- âœ… SKILL.md
- âœ… README.md
- âœ… scripts/ (browse_scenarios.py, generate_playbook_markdown.py)
- âœ… references/ (all JSON files)
- âœ… output/ (test playbooks)
- âœ… Documentation files

---

## Next Steps

1. **Close this Claude Code session**
2. **Open a fresh session** in the correct directory:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/diegocavalariconsolini/ClaudeCode/ClaudeSkillCollection/private/wip-plugins/incident-response-playbook-creator
   ```
3. **Test the plugin** with:
   ```
   Create an incident response playbook for ransomware attacks
   ```

If the plugin loads (you see AskUserQuestion prompts), the fix was successful! ðŸŽ‰

---

**The plugin should now work correctly in fresh Claude Code sessions.**
