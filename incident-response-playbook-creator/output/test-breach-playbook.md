## Overview

### Incident Type
**Data Breach / Exfiltration**

### Description
Unauthorized access and exfiltration of sensitive data

### NIST Reference

Attacker gaining unauthorized access to databases containing personal information


### Severity Level
**CRITICAL**

---

## Incident Classification

**Category**: data-breach
**Severity**: CRITICAL

### NIST CSF 2.0 Alignment
This playbook aligns with the following NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 Functions:
- **DETECT** (DE) - Finding and analyzing possible cybersecurity attacks
- **RESPOND** (RS) - Taking action regarding a detected incident
- **RECOVER** (RC) - Restoring impaired assets and operations

---

## Detection & Indicators

### Technical Indicators of Compromise


1. Unusual database queries or exports

2. Large outbound data transfers

3. Access from unauthorized IP addresses

4. Failed authentication followed by success


### Behavioral Indicators


1. Off-hours database access

2. Access to databases outside normal job function

3. Multiple users reporting account compromises


### Detection Activities

#### Continuous Monitoring (NIST CSF DE.CM)

- DE.CM-03: Monitor user activity for anomalies

- DE.CM-01: Monitor network for data exfiltration


#### Adverse Event Analysis (NIST CSF DE.AE)

- DE.AE-03: Correlate multiple data sources

- DE.AE-08: Determine data types and volumes affected


---

## Response Procedures

### Phase 1: Triage & Assessment

**Objective**: Validate the incident and determine initial scope.

**Actions**:

- Identify affected data types and volume

- Determine unauthorized access method


**Timeframe**: 0-15 minutes from detection

---

### Phase 2: Containment

**Objective**: Prevent incident spread and limit damage.

**Actions**:

- Revoke compromised credentials

- Block attacker IP addresses

- Implement additional access controls


**Timeframe**: 15 minutes - 2 hours from detection

---

### Phase 3: Eradication

**Objective**: Remove the threat and eliminate vulnerabilities.

**Actions**:


**Timeframe**: 2-24 hours from detection

---

## Recovery Actions

**Objective**: Restore normal operations while maintaining security.

### Recovery Procedures


1. Restore proper access controls

2. Implement enhanced monitoring on affected systems

3. Review and update data classification


### Validation Steps

Before declaring incident resolved:
- [ ] Verify all malicious activity has ceased
- [ ] Confirm all affected systems are clean and operational
- [ ] Validate backup integrity (if used for recovery)
- [ ] Review logs for any remaining suspicious activity
- [ ] Implement enhanced monitoring for data breach / exfiltration indicators

**Article 33 - Supervisory Authority Notification**:
Timeline: 72 hours to supervisory authority

**Article 34 - Data Subject Notification**:
Required: Depends on data sensitivity and risk


**Risk Factors**:

- Type of personal data

- Volume of records

- Data sensitivity



---

### HIPAA Requirements


**Breach Determination**: Yes, unauthorized disclosure of PHI

**Notification Timeline**: 60 days to affected individuals

**Risk Assessment Factors**:

- Types of PHI exposed

- Likelihood of re-identification



---

## Roles & Responsibilities

### Incident Response Team Structure


- **Incident Commander**:  Response coordination

- **Forensics Team**:  Investigation and evidence collection
