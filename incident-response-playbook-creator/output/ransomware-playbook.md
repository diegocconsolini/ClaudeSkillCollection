## Overview

### Incident Type
**Ransomware Attack**

### Description
Ransomware deployment preventing system use and potentially causing data breaches

### NIST Reference

Attacker deploying ransomware to prevent use of systems and cause data breaches by copying files


### Severity Level
**CRITICAL**

---

## Incident Classification

**Category**: malware
**Severity**: CRITICAL

### NIST CSF 2.0 Alignment
This playbook aligns with the following NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 Functions:
- **DETECT** (DE) - Finding and analyzing possible cybersecurity attacks
- **RESPOND** (RS) - Taking action regarding a detected incident
- **RECOVER** (RC) - Restoring impaired assets and operations

---

## Detection & Indicators

### Technical Indicators of Compromise


1. Files renamed with extensions: .locked, .crypto, .enc

2. Ransom notes: HELP_DECRYPT, README files

3. Volume Shadow Copies deleted

4. Unusual network traffic to C2 servers


### Behavioral Indicators


1. Users cannot open previously accessible files

2. Desktop wallpaper changed to ransom message

3. Shared drives inaccessible


### Detection Activities

#### Continuous Monitoring (NIST CSF DE.CM)

- DE.CM-09: Monitor endpoint activity for ransomware behavior

- DE.CM-01: Monitor network for C2 communication


#### Adverse Event Analysis (NIST CSF DE.AE)

- DE.AE-02: Analyze alerts for ransomware indicators

- DE.AE-04: Determine scope and affected systems


---

## Response Procedures

### Phase 1: Triage & Assessment

**Objective**: Validate the incident and determine initial scope.

**Actions**:

- Validate ransomware detection

- Identify patient zero and initial infection vector


**Timeframe**: 0-15 minutes from detection

---

### Phase 2: Containment

**Objective**: Prevent incident spread and limit damage.

**Actions**:

- Isolate affected systems from network

- Disable compromised accounts

- Block C2 domains at firewall


**Timeframe**: 15 minutes - 2 hours from detection

---

### Phase 3: Eradication

**Objective**: Remove the threat and eliminate vulnerabilities.

**Actions**:

- Remove ransomware from systems

- Patch vulnerabilities exploited

- Reset all potentially compromised credentials


**Timeframe**: 2-24 hours from detection

---

## Recovery Actions

**Objective**: Restore normal operations while maintaining security.

### Recovery Procedures


1. Restore systems from clean backups

2. Verify backup integrity before restoration

3. Implement enhanced monitoring


### Validation Steps

Before declaring incident resolved:
- [ ] Verify all malicious activity has ceased
- [ ] Confirm all affected systems are clean and operational
- [ ] Validate backup integrity (if used for recovery)
- [ ] Review logs for any remaining suspicious activity
- [ ] Implement enhanced monitoring for ransomware attack indicators

**Article 33 - Supervisory Authority Notification**:
Timeline: 72 hours to supervisory authority

**Article 34 - Data Subject Notification**:
Required: If high risk to individuals


**Risk Factors**:

- Data encryption affecting availability

- Potential data exfiltration



---

### HIPAA Requirements


**Breach Determination**: Yes, if PHI encrypted without HIPAA-compliant encryption

**Notification Timeline**: 60 days from discovery

**Risk Assessment Factors**:

- PHI encryption status

- Evidence of exfiltration



---

## Roles & Responsibilities

### Incident Response Team Structure


- **Incident Commander**:  Overall response coordination

- **IT Security**:  Technical containment and eradication

- **Legal**:  Payment decision guidance, regulatory compliance
