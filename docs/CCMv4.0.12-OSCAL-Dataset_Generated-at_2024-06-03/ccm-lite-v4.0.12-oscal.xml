<p>Implementation Guidelines.Applicable to all service models:</p>
<p>The CSP should regularly conduct independent assurance and audit activities as established by A&amp;A-01. The CSP should also conform and provide a platform to prove that compliance controls are applied and in accordance with relevant standards.The audit activities may vary in scope to cover more or less specific areas in a rotational time frame to make sure the whole of the organization and its service provisions include at least some audit activities throughout the year.</p>
<p>Audits and assurance in terms of this control could mean:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Independent verification of self-assessments </li>
  <li>Physical control reviews and evidence-based claim assessments</li>
  <li>Performance or testing control effectiveness such as penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and red team exercises</li>
</ol>
<p>Audit activities should be conducted by a competent independent internal or external party. </p>
<p>The CSP may choose to implement a Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) tool, either its own or a third-party solution, to enhance audit and assurance activities.</p>
<p>The CSP should not rely only on self assessments, internal gap analysis, or any other metrics that are produced by internal auditing, internal scans, etc., since internal self-alerting biases may exist.</p>

The CSP&#x2019;s independent audit and assurance assessments may be utilized to gauge the security posture of its own cloud services&#x2019; infrastructure. However, the CSC should also perform independent assessments of the CSP to demonstrate compliance with its own (CSC&#x2019;s) requirements. Both CSP and CSC are responsible for reviewing the impact of changing risks on audit and assurance assessments.</p>
<p>Implementation Guidelines.Applicable to all service models:</p>
<p>The CSP should implement a regime of independent assurance and audit activities using a risk-based approach. The CSP is recommended to adhere to operational activities and procedures in auditing and risk management standards.</p>
<p>Because the CSC will generally need to rely on the independent audits, assessments, and attestations engaged by and for the CSP, the CSP should ensure that the objectives and scopes of the independent assurance activities are clearly defined and that the objectives and scopes are documented and communicated with adequate clarity and specificity to the CSC.</p>
<p>In particular, the CSP's documentation of objectives and scope should be clear, unambiguous, and have specific delineation as to which cloud services, which resources (including data), and which service features and options were assessed. This permits the CSC to adequately and appropriately rely on the assurance activities and reports provided by the CSP.</p>

<p>Implementation Guidelines.Applicable to all service models:</p>
<p>The CSC should implement an effective risk-based internal and external audit scheme. Internal audit risk assessments should be performed by a team internal to the CSC. It should determine priority, details to be considered, frequency of audit, and general risks to which the CSC is exposed. External assessments should be performed by an independent organization.</p>
<p>The CSC&#x2019;s Audit Manager should prepare reports showing the audit scope and cycle. It should work with auditors to evaluate the risks posed to various departments and functions. </p>
<p>Audits may leverage System and Organization Controls (SOC) reports and others from independent third parties. </p>
<p>The CSC's deployment model choice is informed by the business needs and the responsibilities it is willing to assume.</p>
<p>When relying on independent audits, assessments, attestations, and other third-party assurances provided by the CSP, the CSC should pay careful attention to the documented objectives and scope to ensure they adequately cover the services consumed by the CSC.</p>
<p>The CSC should perform the following to achieve its obligations within the SSRM:</p>
<p>Conduct independent third-party compliance audit and assurance activities in line with regulations and standardsRegularly update and reassess audit and assurance activities within scope and criteria</p>

More specifically, the audit of a CSP might cover only a portion of the technology stack used by a CSC. This audit excludes how CSCs utilize the stack, configure services, manage access, monitor service usage, and choose what data to place in the cloud. Consequently, even if the CSP complies with relevant standards, regulations, legal/contractual, and statutory requirements, CSCs still need to assess their own cloud activities for compliance. To this end, CSCs should implement suitable controls and processes regardless of whether the CSP demonstrates adherence to the same standards, regulations, legal/contractual, and statutory requirements. Therefore, the CSC should be aware that it should not rely solely on the CSP&#x2019;s independent audits and need to conduct its own audit activities.</p>

<p>Implementation Guidelines.Applicable to all service models:</p>
<p>The CSP should maintain a Risk Management program to mitigate and manage risk. Management should have a process that requires it to identify risks within its area of responsibility and to implement appropriate measures to address those risks.</p>
<p>Findings of audit and assurance activities should be given due care and attention at the appropriate levels. If a control deficiency (finding) is identified, the deficiency should be evaluated for prioritization. Once prioritized, the appropriate risk treatment should be selected.</p>
<p>Options to treat risks should be clearly defined and evaluated, which could include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Mitigating risk by increasing the effectiveness of controls</li>
  <li>Mitigating the risk by implementing compensating controls</li>

<ol>
  <li>Applications Categorization:</li>
  <li>A risk-based approach should be used to identify, classify and categorize all relevant cloud applications and APIs based on the sensitivity, criticality, and the type of data they handle, and regulatory requirementsii.

Both the CSP and CSC are responsible for independently defining and implementing a Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC) process for secure application design, development, deployment, and operation in accordance with system security requirements defined by each cloud party.For deployments within the SaaS model, this control resides with the CSP, since SaaS CSPs typically offer ready-to-use applications and services, while the SaaS CSC consumes the service and is not responsible for implementing a SSDLC for application development.</p>
<p>Implementation Guidelines.Applicable to all service models:</p>
<p>CSPs should leverage an SSDLC process to ensure that applications and APIs are securely designed, developed, deployed, and operated in their cloud environments. Integration of security best practices throughout the entire development lifecycle, can help CSPs to effectively protect their applications from vulnerabilities and cyberattacks.</p>
<p>Defining security requirements should be the first step in the SSDLC process to ensure that security is integrated throughout all phases of development. Security requirements should derive from security objectives and/or organizational goals and regulatory requirements. Industry standards should be applied at project inception and every stage of the SSDLC process. To successfully promote SSDLC security, roles and expectations should be clearly defined, published and communicated to relevant stakeholders.</p>
<p>The following best practices should be followed when implementing an SSDLC:</p>

<ol>
  <li>SSDLC Governance: A security governance framework should be implemented that is tailored to the SSDLC and that defines roles, responsibilities, and accountability for security throughout the SSDLC</li>
  <li>The CSP&#x2019;s SSDLC processes, at a minimum, should meet the regulatory and CSC&#x2019;s business requirementsii. The CSP should provide information to CSCs about the SSDLC to the extent compatible with their disclosure policies</li>
  <li>DevSecOps: A DevSecOps approach should be defined and implemented that integrates security practices into all stages of the SSDLC, from planning and design to development, testing, deployment, and operation, rather than being an afterthought</li>
  <li>Threat Modeling: Threat modeling should be incorporated into the early stages of the SSDLC to identify potential security risks and design mitigation strategies to help developers anticipate and proactively address security issues, reducing the likelihood of vulnerabilities being introduced later in the development cycle</li>
  <li>Secure Coding Practices: </li>
  <li>Comprehensive security design requirements should be defined that specify the security measures and controls to be implemented throughout the application's architectureii. Industry standard (OWASP, etc) secure coding guidelines should be incorporated in the SSDLCiii. Secure coding guidelines should be followed and implemented respectively (e.g., proper implementation and configuration of security headers, input validation, information output handling, error handling, and proper use of cryptographic libraries)</li>
  <li>Open Source Components Secure Use: Secure practices for managing open-source components should be employed, including thorough vulnerability scanning, dependency management, and continuous monitoring for known vulnerabilities. Use trusted open-source repositories and ensure proper attribution and licensing compliance</li>
  <li>Vulnerability Management: Continuously scan for and remediate vulnerabilities in code, infrastructure, and third-party components (refer to TVM domain)</li>
  <li>Security Testing: Regular security audits, static, dynamic application security testing, and penetration testing should be conducted to identify and address potential security weaknesses (refer to AIS-05 and TVM-06)</li>
  <li>Secure Deployment and Configuration Management:</li>
  <li>Secure deployment and configuration management practices should be implemented to ensure that cloud-based applications are deployed and configured in a secure mannerii. Automated tools should be used to enforce consistent configurations and monitor for deviations from security policies</li>
  <li>EoL Process: When an application reaches its end-of-life, a CSP should at minimum:</li>
  <li>Notify CSCs of the EoL date and provide clear instructions on how to migrate to alternative servicesii. Discontinue providing technical support and updates for the application and archive the application's source code and documentationiii. Ensure that all application associated data is properly deleted or transferred to the CSC's designated locationiv. Review and assess potential security vulnerabilities during the decommissioning process</li>
</ol>
<p>The CSPs should be transparent about their security practices and provide CSCs with the necessary tools and support to meet their security requirements. The CSCs should actively engage with CSPs to ensure that their security requirements are implemented and maintained throughout the SSDLC.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Standardized Deployment Process: Standardized deployment processes should be implemented to ensure consistent and secure application deployments. This includes:</li>
  <li>Security requirements definition based on application deployment needs and industry standards to ensure applications are protected from unauthorized access, data breaches, and other cybersecurity threatsii.

        <part id="AIS-07_imp_gui_csp" name="item"><title>CSP implementation guidelines</title><prop name="label" value="CSP"/><p>Control Ownership Rationale.The implementation responsibility of this control is a shared responsibility between the CSP and CSC, however doing so independently from one another. The CSP is responsible for defining and implementing a process to remediate application security vulnerabilities and automating remediation when possible.</p>
<p>Implementation Guidelines.Applicable to all service models:</p>
<p>Application security vulnerabilities are a serious threat to cloud-based applications. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to applications, steal sensitive data, and disrupt operations. CSPs play a critical role in helping CSCs remediate application security vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>The following best practices should be followed for implementing a vulnerability remediation process:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Vulnerability Remediation Scope: A process for defining the scope of a vulnerability remediation should be established (e.g., IaaS CSPs may only be responsible for remediating vulnerabilities in the underlying infrastructure, while PaaS CSPs may also be responsible for remediating vulnerabilities in the platform software)</li>
  <li>Remediation Plan: A remediation plan for each vulnerability should be developed and include the steps that need to be taken to remediate the vulnerability, the estimated time to remediate the vulnerability, and the resources that will be required</li>
  <li>The plan should include processes and procedures for vulnerabilities remediation in coordination with development teams, the CSC, and for implementing security patches in a timely manner</li>
  <li>Remediation Prioritization and Risk Assessment:</li>
  <li>The severity and potential impact of identified vulnerabilities should be assessed based on factors such as exploitability, target scope, and potential consequencesii. Vulnerability assessment tools should be utilized to provide risk scoresiii. Vulnerabilities remediation should be prioritized based on their risk scores, considering factors such as business criticality, asset value, regulatory compliance requirements, and industry standard vulnerability scoring systems such as CVSS if applicableiv. Threat intelligence feeds should be incorporated into the prioritization process to identify vulnerabilities actively exploited by attackers</li>
  <li>Track and Measure Progress: Progress on remediation efforts should be tracked and the effectiveness of the vulnerability remediation process measured</li>
  <li>Patch Management Automation: Application of patches should be automated to reduce the time and effort required to remediate vulnerabilities and improve the overall security posture of cloud-based applications (refer to TVM domain)</li>
  <li>Remediation Automation:</li>
  <li>Configuration management tools should be utilized to automatically correct misconfigured security settings and enforce secure configurations across different environments using secure by default principlesii. Automated code refactoring tools should be employed to address insecure coding practices and enforce secure coding guidelines within applicationsiii. Automated dependency management tools should be utilized to update and replace vulnerable open-source components with patched or updated versionsiv. Automated remediation hooks should be implemented within the CI/CD pipeline to automatically remediate identified vulnerabilities before and after deployment</li>
  <li>Remediation Logging: Comprehensive logging of remediation activities should be established to track the remediation process and identify potential issues</li>
  <li>Post-Remediation Verification: Post-remediation verification steps should be implemented to ensure that vulnerabilities have been effectively addressed and that no new vulnerabilities have been introduced</li>
  <li>Continuous Remediation Monitoring: The effectiveness of the vulnerability remediation process should be continuously monitored and improvements made as needed</li>
  <li>Notification and Reporting: Notification and reporting mechanisms should be established to inform relevant stakeholders of any vulnerabilities detected and remediation actions taken</li>
  <li>Communicate with CSCs any identified vulnerabilities and the plan to remediate them. Communication should be timely and transparent in accordance with agreed SLAs</li>
</ol>
<p>Vulnerabilities should be identified and remediated as early as possible in the SSDLC and automated processes are ideal for such a task.</p>
<p>Vulnerability Scanning and Remediation Examples:</p>
<p>To ensure that only secure and hardened container images are used in the application development process, integrate a vulnerability scanner into the CI/CD pipeline specifically for "image" scanning. This will guarantee that only secure "images" (also known as golden images) are incorporated into the application software builds.</p>
<p>Automated scanning tools are an effective solution for identifying and remediating such issues. For instance, cloud agent-based tools can be deployed on each active VM instance to continuously scan for third-party security vulnerabilities, with the frequency of scans determined by the organization's security strategy (daily, weekly, etc.).</p>

        <part id="AIS-07_imp_gui_csc" name="item"><title>CSC implementation guidelines</title><prop name="label" value="CSC"/><p>Control Ownership Rationale.Widespread vulnerabilities may require action by both the CSP and CSC, however the CSC is responsible for remediating vulnerabilities in their cloud environment.  </p>
<p>In the SaaS model, the CSC is responsible for identifying vulnerabilities related to any application-level misconfigurations (e.g., API configuration settings, access control settings) that are within the control of the CSC. Therefore, while the SaaS customer is not responsible for identifying infrastructure and insecure code related vulnerabilities on the SaaS application it consumes, it may have to coordinate with the CSP to identify, understand, and manage any vulnerabilities related to the application stack the CSC owns and controls, including the applications vulnerabilities remediation and response scheduling.</p>
<p>Implementation Guidelines.The implementation guidelines as provided for the CSP apply to IaaS, PaaS CSC.</p>
<p>In addition, as it pertains to the SaaS CSC, misconfigurations can be considered a vulnerability, as they can inadvertently expose the application to security risks and potential breaches.SaaS CSC implementation guidelines for application security vulnerabilities remediation include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Configuration Management: Ensuring that the application's configuration settings are appropriately set up to align with the organization's security requirements and best practices. This involves properly configuring access controls, user permissions, and encryption settings (including the use of strong encryption protocols and properly managed encryption keys)</li>
  <li>Default Security Configurations: Customize and strengthen default security configurations to align with organizational security policies. To remediate such vulnerabilities: </li>
  <li>Regularly review and update default security settings to address emerging security threatsii. Conduct regular security assessments to identify any weaknesses in default security settings</li>
  <li>Access Control Management: Implementing robust access controls and authentication mechanisms to regulate user access and privileges within the SaaS application. This includes managing user roles, permissions, and identity verification to prevent unauthorized access and unauthorized activities within the application</li>
  <li>Unmanaged Shadow IT and Unsanctioned Applications: Usage of unsanctioned or unmanaged applications by employees within the SaaS CSC organization can introduce security risks and vulnerabilities that may not be adequately addressed or monitored by the SaaS CSP. To remediate such vulnerabilities:</li>
  <li>Implement strict policies to prevent the use of unsanctioned applications and shadow ITii. Provide clear guidelines and recommendations to personnel for approved applications and IT resourcesiii. Monitor network traffic and application usage to detect any unauthorized or unmanaged applications</li>

More specifically, each party should conduct their own Business Impact Analysis (BIA), define parameters such as Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO), and perform an independent risk assessment.</p>
<p>Implementation Guidelines.Applicable to all service models:</p>
<p>The CSP is responsible for ensuring a business continuity and operational resilience strategy for the CSP&#x2019;s services. By implementing a business impact analysis (BIA) and risk assessment process, the CSP can effectively identify, assess, and mitigate potential disruptions and risks, enabling the CSC to maintain business operations in the face of adverse events.</p>
<p>The CSP should implement the following best practices in its own business impact analysis (BIA) and risk assessment process:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Information Governance Incorporation: BIAs and risk assessment activities should be integrated into the Information Governance Program (refer to GRC-01) ensuring alignment with organizational goals and risk tolerance</li>
  <li>BIA and Risk Assessment Team: A cross-functional team should be formed with representatives from IT, operations, business units, and risk management to ensure a comprehensive perspective</li>
  <li>BIA and Risk Assessment:  A systematic risk assessment process or risk-based approach should be implemented and maintained from the Enterprise Risk Management Program (ERM) (GRC-02) in order to document a standardized methodology for conducting BIA and risk assessment exercises, ensuring consistency and repeatability</li>
  <li>The potential impact of disruptions on critical business processes, data, and systems should be analyzedii. Risks should be prioritized based on their likelihood and potential impact and establish risk tolerance levels for cloud-based services</li>
</ol>
<p>The Business Impact Analysis (BIA) should include (but not limited to):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Impact Categories and Criteria Definition: The impact categories and criteria that align with the organization's unique business context should be determined. These categories should reflect the organization's priorities, tolerance for disruption, and the potential consequences of disruptions</li>
  <li>Impact Measurements: The established impact categories and criteria to systematically measure the potential impact of disruptions on critical business activities should be utilized. This involves assigning impact levels based on the defined criteria</li>
  <li>Critical Activities Identification: Activities that are essential for the organization to deliver its products and services should be mapped out</li>
  <li>Impact over Time Analysis: The impact of disruptions on critical activities evolves over time should be analyzed and cumulative effects of prolonged disruptions considered</li>
  <li>Acceptable Recovery Timeframes: The timeframes within which the impact of disruptions to critical activities becomes unacceptable for the organization should be defined. These timeframes serve as benchmarks for prioritizing recovery strategies</li>
  <li>Recovery Activities Prioritization: The acceptable impact timeframes should be broken down into prioritized timeframes for specific critical activities to guide resource allocation and recovery efforts</li>
  <li>Resource Identification and Dependency Mapping:</li>
  <li>The resources required to support and recover prioritized critical activities should be determined. This includes identifying both physical and human resourcesii. The dependencies and interdependencies among prioritized critical activities and their supporting resources should be identified and mapped in order to understand the cascading effects of disruptions</li>
  <li>Infrastructure Resource Listing:</li>
  <li>A comprehensive list of all infrastructure resources (e.g., computing, network devices, storage, and software components) required to provision cloud services should be createdii. Identify Infrastructure Resource Dependencies the dependencies among infrastructure resources should be identified and documented. This helps to understand the potential impact of disruptions to individual resources on the overall cloud infrastructure</li>
</ol>
<p>The BIA risk assessment should include (but not be limited to):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Risks of Disruption to Prioritized Activities: The potential risks of disruption to prioritized critical activities should be systematically identified and documented.

  <li>Risks of Disruption to Supporting Resources: The potential risks of disruption to the cloud physical and human resources that support prioritized critical activities should be also identified and documented</li>
  <li>Risks of Disruption Analysis: A systematic analysis of the identified risks of disruption should be conducted by evaluating the likelihood and impact of each risk to determine its overall severity</li>
  <li>Risks of Disruption Requiring Treatment: The identified risks of disruption that require treatment or mitigation strategies should be prioritized and evaluated. It involves assessing the potential benefits and costs of implementing countermeasures</li>
  <li>Automation Processes: Automation tools should be leveraged to streamline data collection, analysis, and reporting, improving efficiency and effectiveness</li>
  <li>BIA and Risk Assessment Reviews: Regular reviews of BIA and risk assessment findings should be scheduled to ensure ongoing relevance and effectiveness</li>

The business continuity strategies should consist of one or more solutions.The adopted BC strategies of the CSC may depend on certain services and resilience capabilities offered by the CSP, but the CSC does not depend on the CSP&#x2019;s involvement in developing, adopting, or otherwise establishing the CSC&#x2019;s strategies.</p>
<p>In order to achieve RTO and RPO based on the business continuity strategy, the CSC can opt for a Multi-cloud  strategy (different products and services to achieve its business objective).</p>
<p>Implementation Guidelines.The CSC should identify and select appropriate business continuity strategies and solutions taking into consideration their associated costs for:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Disruption Response Costs Optimization: A cost-effective incident response plan should be implemented that prioritizes rapid identification, containment, and recovery from disruptions to minimize downtime and associated revenue losses</li>
  <li>Cost-Efficient Resource Provisioning: A cloud-based infrastructure that enables scalable resource provisioning and cost optimization for prioritized activities should be employed for continued service delivery at a minimum cost</li>
</ol>
<p>For the prioritized activities, the CSC should identify and select strategies and solutions considering business continuity objectives and the amount and type of risk that CSC may take, that include (but not limited to):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Disruption Likelihood Reduction: Proactive monitoring and alerting systems should be implemented to identify and address potential issues before they cause disruptions</li>
  <li>Disruption Period Reduction: Multi-cloud strategies should be utilized to distribute workloads across multiple cloud providers, reducing reliance on a single infrastructure</li>
  <li>Disruption Impact Limitation: Load balancing and auto-scaling should be implemented to distribute traffic and prevent overload during disruptions</li>

More specifically, the CSP offers backup and restore services, and is responsible for the infrastructure that supports these services. The CSC, on the other hand, is responsible for correctly leveraging these services to secure their data (e.g., select data to backup, enable encryption and verify data restoration functionality).</p>
<p>Implementation Guidelines.Applicable to all service models:</p>
<p>To ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data stored in the cloud, the CSPs should implement a comprehensive set of technical measures that encompass data security, backup, and restoration procedures.</p>
<p>Implementation best practices for the CSP to periodically backup data stored in the cloud include (but not limited):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Backup Strategy: A backup strategy should be established that includes regular backup schedules, incremental backups, and full backups, including the physical location of backup files, which should comply with the privacy and data protection laws and regulations applicable to the data collected</li>
  <li>Multiple backup methods, including cloud-based backup services, on-premises storage, and offline backups should be utilizedii. The 3-2-1 backup rule can be used: three copies of data on two different media, with one copy stored offsite</li>
  <li>Separate Location Backup: Backups should be stored in a separate location physically or logically isolated from the primary cloud data storage</li>
  <li>Backup Encryption: Backup data should be encrypted with strong encryption algorithms and secure key management practices to prevent unauthorized access</li>
  <li>Backup Integrity Verification: The integrity of backups should be regularly verified with the use of data integrity verification mechanisms like cryptographic hashes, checksums or message authentication codes (MACs) to ensure they are not corrupted or tampered with</li>
  <li>Backup Repository Access Control:  Access control for backup repositories should be implemented to prevent unauthorized access and access permissions should be regularly reviewed and updated</li>
  <li>Backup Retention and Archiving: </li>
  <li>Data retention policies should be established to determine the scope, frequency, and duration of cloud data backups and in compliance with applicable laws/regulations, contractual agreements (SLAs), and CSP&#x2019;s business requirementsii. Data archiving strategies should be implemented to ensure long-term data preservation and compliance with regulatory requirementsiii. Automatically purge outdated backups in accordance with the retention policy</li>
  <li>Backup Monitoring and Auditing:  Backup processes should be continuously monitored to ensure backups are running successfully and data integrity is maintained</li>
  <li>Data Restoration and Resiliency: </li>
  <li>RPOs and RTOs should be defined and used as metrics to guide backup frequency and recovery strategiesii. A comprehensive data restoration plan should be established that outlines the steps to restore data from backups in case of data loss or corruption. Regularly test the plan to ensure its effectivenessiii. Backup restorations should be carried out only after they have been approved by authorized personnel (according to contractual agreements with CSCs or the internal policies of the CSP)iv. Backup and data restoration processes should be automated to minimize manual intervention, downtime and expedite recovery</li>
  <li>Use automation tools to schedule backups, monitor backup health, trigger restorations and manage the restoration workflowvi. Replicate data to multiple data centers or geographic regions to ensure data availability in case of regional outages or disasters. Use replication technologies like synchronous or asynchronous replicationvii. Backup restores should be regularly tested to ensure the ability to recover from data loss or corruption</li>
  <li>Backup Monitoring and Logging: Continuous monitoring and logging of data backup and restoration processes should be implemented to detect and address any potential issues promptly. Use monitoring tools to track backup status, data integrity, restoration performance, and set up alerts for any anomalies or failures in the backup system</li>
  <li>Third-Party Assessments: Engage in third-party security assessments and to validate the effectiveness of backup and security measures</li>
  <li>Communication with the CSC: The CSP, when appropriate, should be able to disclose the backup and restoration test results to the CSC as part of the assurance of business continuity and resilience</li>
  <li>Backup Review and Update:  Backup and recovery plans should be regularly reviewed and updated to reflect changes in data volumes, infrastructure, and regulatory requirements to ensure that plans are aligned with current business needs and security standards</li>

All configuration changes to systems should be independently baselined, tested, and approved according to their corporate policies and in line with industry standards.</p>
<p>Implementation Guidelines.Applicable to all service models:</p>
<p>The CSP should establish procedures and implement technical measures to prevent and/or detect any unwanted/unauthorized changes (e.g., additions, removals, and updates) to organizational assets in production, including applications, systems, infrastructure, configurations.</p>
<p>Organizations should permit only qualified and authorized individuals to access systems for purposes of initiating changes. Access restrictions include physical and logical access controls such as cryptographic controls or MFA.</p>
<p>Implementation best practices for this control include (but not limited to):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Centralized Asset Management System: An accurate and up-to-date inventory of all organization assets should be leveraged and used as a single source for tracking the addition, removal, updates of assets (refer to DCS-06) </li>
  <li>Change Identity and Access Management: A robust IAM system should be implemented to control user access and changes to assets based on their identities, roles, and entitlements. Strong authentication mechanisms should be used, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), to prevent unauthorized changes to assets</li>
  <li>Change by Least Privilege Principle: The principle of least privilege should be implemented to minimize the risk of unauthorized or accidental changes by restricting access to sensitive assets and configurations</li>
  <li>Change by SoD: Ensure sufficient separation of duties exists, such that that same team cannot both develop and authorize changes</li>
  <li>Change Monitoring and Logging: </li>
  <li>Cloud assets configurations, access logs, and user activities should be continuously monitored to detect unauthorized changes or anomalous behaviorii. Unauthorized or unintended changes that could compromise security or disrupt cloud services should be detected, investigated and reported oniii. Automated monitoring tools should be used to identify potential security threats and prevent unauthorized changes</li>
  <li>Segregate Environments: Segregation of production systems from development and testing environments should be leveraged to minimize the risk of unauthorized changes or security vulnerabilities affecting production systems</li>

All configuration changes to systems utilized should be managed appropriately within the agreement between the CSP and CSC. For the CSP to implement this control and include its provisions in SLAs (i.e., limiting changes impacting the CSCs&#x2019; systems), there is a role for the CSC to play, namely to discuss, refine, and approve such provisions.</p>
<p>Implementation Guidelines.Processes and procedures established by both the CSP and CSC should reflect change management responsibilities. Each party should acknowledge the other&#x2019;s responsibility, which should be part of a written change management agreement. The acknowledgment should include a reference to limitations related to changes impacting CSC-owned environments. The CSC should be able to configure, control or communicate exclusion windows to the CSP when changes cannot occur.</p>
<p>IaaS Provider:</p>
<p>The CSP is responsible for establishing their change management and testing processes, only for the compute, storage, and networking resources offered as part of the IaaS service. No changes should be undertaken to these systems without prior notice to the CSC as the dependent applications could be negatively affected by any CSP-managed asset being changed.The CSP Forward Schedule of Changes (FSC) program should be agreed with the CSC as part of a service level agreement.</p>
<p>PaaS Provider:</p>
<p>The CSP has responsibility for the design, implementation, and management of all supporting infrastructure&#x2014;virtual elastic compute, server operating systems, storage, and networking&#x2014;but also middleware, development tools, business intelligence services and database management systems, so any change should be agreed in advance by the CSC prior to implementation.</p>

<p>Applicable to all service models:</p>
<p>Additional recommendations that apply for the CSP include (but not limited to):</p>

<ol>
  <li>SLA Authorized Changes and Definition: </li>
  <li>The change management process should be integrated with SLAs to ensure that both CSCs and CSPs are accountable for adhering to this processii. What constitutes an authorized change should be defined in the SLA such as specifying the types of changes, the scope of changes, and the approval process for each type of change</li>
  <li>Change Management Notification and Approval: CSPs should notify the CSCs of and have the opportunity to review and approve any configuration changes that may impact their cloud environment</li>
  <li>A formal change management process should be established with clear notification procedures for CSCs (e.g., a change request (CR) process that includes detailed information about the proposed change, its purpose, impact, potential risks, and rollback procedures)ii. Provide CSCs with detailed information about proposed changes, including the potential impact on their environmentiii. Provide CSCs with timely notifications about proposed changes, including the CR, the expected impact, and the timeline for implementationiv. Obtain CSC approval for proposed changes impacting the CSC environment before implementation</li>
  <li>Schedule changes that directly impact CSC-owned environments/tenants during agreed-upon maintenance windows (whenever possible)</li>
  <li>Change Rollback and Remediation: Remediation procedures should be established within SLAs in case of unauthorized or disruptive changes, including rollback strategies and compensation mechanisms</li>
  <li>Post-change reports: Provide CSCs with post-change reports summarizing the implementation of the change, any issues encountered, and the final state of the environment</li>
  <li>Continuous Monitoring and Evaluation: CSPs should continuously monitor and improve their change management processes to minimize disruption to CSCs' environments</li>
  <li>Include change management performance metrics in SLAs to measure the effectiveness of the process in preventing unauthorized or disruptive changesii. Solicit feedback from CSCs on their change management processesiii. Review and update the SLA provisions related to change management regularly to reflect changes in cloud infrastructure, applications, and CSCs&#x2019; requirements</li>
</ol>
<p>NOTE: In an emergency, the CSP may need to apply changes that impact the CSC-owned environments without the explicit authorization of the CSC, in case those emergency changes would be required for the overall security of the CSP&#x2019;s system. If those types of changes are applied, the CSC should be consulted as soon as possible (Refer to exception change management procedures in CCC-08).</p>

<p>Implementation Guidelines.Applicable to all service models:</p>
<p>A change management baseline is a snapshot of the current state of all cloud assets at a specific point in time. This baseline serves as a reference point against which all subsequent changes to cloud assets are evaluated and measured. </p>
<p>The purpose of establishing a change management baseline is to ensure that changes are controlled, authorized, and implemented in a consistent and orderly manner to minimize the risk of unintended consequences and maintain the security and integrity of the cloud environment.</p>
<p>The CSP should develop, document, and maintain under version control current baseline configurations and should review and update the baseline configurations when required due to updates or newly installed components.</p>
<p>Implementation best practices for this control include (but are not limited to):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Change Management Baseline: A change management baseline should be implemented that includes a standard and approved state of the organization&#x2019;s cloud assets that serves as a reference point for the changes. The baseline should include:</li>
  <li>A list of all cloud assets (e.g., CMDB), including hardware, software components, their relevant data, their attributes and relationships, enabling effective change managementii. The configuration/security settings, version numbers, patch status that are subject to change management should be captured for each cloud asset (e.g., virtualization, network settings, security settings, and VMs, applications/APIs configuration)iii. Key performance indicators (KPIs) that measure the health, performance, and utilization of cloud assetsiv. The current security posture of the cloud environment, including vulnerability assessments, risk assessments, and compliance audits</li>
  <li>Documentation:  An accurate documentation for each cloud asset baseline should be maintained, including its creation date, author, and associated assets</li>
  <li>Changes Tracking and Implementation: </li>
  <li>All changes made to cloud assets should be monitored and tracked against the baseline and be well documented (e.g., who made the change, when it was made, what was changed, and any issues or incidents that arise reported on)ii. Version control systems (e.g., Git) should be utilized to track baseline changes and maintain historical recordsiii. Proposed changes should be evaluated against the baseline and associated policies before approvaliv. The baseline should be updated and documented whenever a new change is implemented, and be stored and backed up in a secure and accessible location</li>
  <li>Deployed changes should be post-verified that match the approved version and adhere to the established baseline</li>

<p>Implementation Guidelines.Applicable to all service models:</p>
<p>Implementing a robust process for proactively rolling back changes to a previously known good state in case of errors or security concerns is essential for CSPs to maintain the stability, security, and reliability of their cloud services. A well-defined rollback process ensures that changes can be reversed quickly and effectively, minimizing the potential impact of errors or security incidents. The CSC should be notified if deployment of changes fail and if the roll back occurred.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Rollback Baseline: </li>
  <li>A rollback baseline that includes snapshots, backups and restore points of all critical cloud assets at a known stable state should serve as a reference point for recovery and restoring the environmentii. Detailed change logs and backups of configurations should be maintained to facilitate rollback procedures</li>
  <li>Rollback Process: </li>
  <li>Rollback process and supporting procedures should be established that can be implemented quickly and effectively in case of issuesii. Rollback procedures should include identifying rollback points, triggering rollbacks, and verifying the success of rollbacksiii. Rollback procedures should be automated whenever possible to minimize the time and effort required to revert changes (automated tools can be used to restore configurations, data, and applications from the rollback baseline)</li>
  <li>Rollback Triggers: The triggers for initiating a rollback should be defined, including specific error codes, security alerts, or performance degradation beyond acceptable thresholds and should be configurable to align with the CSP's risk tolerance and security policies</li>
  <li>Rollback Testing Strategy: Rollback procedures should be regularly tested to ensure they are effective and functioning as intended. Use staging environments or isolated test environments to conduct rollback simulations without impacting production systems</li>
  <li>Rollback Procedures Documentation: Rollback procedures should be documented, including the steps involved, the tools used, and the expected outcomes</li>
  <li>Rollback and Change Management Integration: Rollback procedures should be integrated with the change management process to ensure that rollback plans are considered during change implementation and that rollback triggers are aligned with change approval processes</li>
  <li>Rollback History: A history of rollback events should be maintained, including the date, time, reason for rollback, and the specific changes reverted. This historical data provides valuable insights for identifying patterns, improving rollback procedures, and demonstrating compliance with security regulations</li>
  <li>Rollback Procedures Reviews: Rollback procedures should be regularly reviewed and refined based on testing results, feedback from rollback events, and evolving security threats or cloud infrastructure changes</li>
  <li>Rollback Simulation Exercises: </li>
  <li>Periodic rollback simulation exercises should be conducted to test the effectiveness of rollback procedures and identify areas for improvementii. Have a dedicated team responsible for handling change rollbacks and remediation efforts</li>

The CSP should offer cryptography services, and in such a case it is responsible for the infrastructure that supports these services. The CSC, on the other hand, is responsible for correctly using these services to secure their data, for instance, choosing when and what data to encrypt, and managing access to encryption keys.</p>
<p>Implementation Guidelines.The CSP should have a robust system for cryptographic management with clear policies and procedures for encryption and key management, including key generation, distribution, rotation, revocation, destruction, activation, suspension, deactivation, archival, compromise, recovery, inventory management, purposes, and access. These policies should be reviewed and updated at least annually.</p>
<p>IaaS Provider:</p>
<p>Policies and procedures should be in place that dictate how and when these encryption methods are to be used, who has access to the keys, how the lifecycle of these keys is managed, roles and responsibilities, data protection, change management, risk management, monitoring, reporting, incident handling, and audit. An IaaS provider should offer mechanisms for encryption both in transit and at rest for all data, along with a key management service. The CSP should ensure that these services comply with the latest security standards and best practices.</p>
<p>PaaS Provider:</p>
<p>Policies and procedures should be in place to guide the usage and management of these encryption methods and keys, including change management and risk management practices. A PaaS provider should offer platform-level encryption for data at rest and in transit, including a secure key management system. The CSP should adhere to security best practices and standards, including data protection protocols like data encryption and algorithm selection.</p>
<p>SaaS Provider:</p>
<p>Policies and procedures should be in place that dictate how encryption is handled at the application level, including key management, again featuring the full spectrum of key management activities. The provider should ensure all data at rest and in transit is encrypted using approved cryptographic protection methods. The CSP should offer the CSC the ability to manage their own keys where feasible and monitor the technology closely to keep up with emergence of threats and vulnerabilities. The CSP should ensure incident handling procedures, audit mechanisms, and activity logging for encryption and key management processes.</p>
<p>Policies should include (but not limited to) provisions on the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Scope and Objectives:</li>
  <li>Scope definition and governance of the organization's use of cryptography, encryption, and key management practices to protect sensitive dataii. Objectives for the secure implementation of cryptographic controls for data security and the establishment of key management practices to safeguard encryption keys from unauthorized access, modification, or disclosure</li>
  <li>Roles and Responsibilities: Responsibilities of all entities involved in managing cryptographic controls and the encryption key lifecycle. This includes responsibilities for generating, distributing, storing, rotating, and disposing of keys</li>
  <li>Encryption Standards: Cryptographic data security and protection requirements, for both data in transit and at rest and covering the necessary encryption standards, algorithms and best practices</li>

<p>Implementation Guidelines.IaaS Provider:</p>

<ol>
  <li>define and enforce roles and responsibilities around key managers, ensuring they cannot access protected data or the cryptographic engine. Also, provide the CSC with robust access controls and role definition capabilities within their platform. This includes enabling the CSC to implement the principles of SoD and split knowledge</li>
  <li>incorporate practices like SoD, splitting knowledge, and least privilege access to cryptographic resources and processes</li>
  <li>establish clear policies for the management of both operational and backed-up key information storage and recovery. Assist customers in defining cryptoperiods, overseeing key and digital certificate inventories, and verifying the integrity of stored key information prior to use. Manage the process of revoking compromised keys and creating replacement keys or digital certificates. Maintain transparency throughout these processes</li>

<p>Implementation Guidelines.Applicable to all service models:</p>
<p>Before rotating a key, ensure that all data previously encrypted with the old key version can be decrypted. Depending on organizational policies and the technology capacity of the system, old data may be automatically or manually re-encrypted with the new key version after key rotation.</p>
<p>When rotating keys, consider the following principles:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Data Decryption: Non-primary (old) keys should be used to decrypt data previously encrypted before re-encrypting the data with new keys</li>
  <li>Data Re-encryption: Old data may be re-encrypted using new keys based on organizational policy and technology capacity</li>
  <li>Algorithm Strength: This includes the strength of the encryption algorithm, the length of the key, and the mode of operation used</li>
  <li>Transactions Volume: the volume of information flow or the number of transactions that may impact the processing time required for key rotation and how frequently key rotation is necessary</li>
  <li>Data Sensitivity and Lifetime Protection: This includes how long the data needs to be protected, the sensitivity of the data, and the potential risks associated with data compromise</li>
  <li>Crypto-Security Functions: Functions such as data encryption, digital signature, and key protection may be impacted by key rotation and should be considered</li>
  <li>Key Copies Number: the number of key copies and the distribution of those copies and ensuring that all relevant key copies are updated during the rotation process</li>
  <li>Keys Rotation Logging: All key rotation activities should be logged and recorded in the CKMS or inventory management system</li>

<p>Implementation Guidelines.Applicable to all service models:</p>
<p>The CSP should incorporate comprehensive security measures into its policies and procedures to maintain a secure and safe working environment in offices for employees. This involves implementing stringent access controls, surveillance systems, and security personnel to monitor and enforce security policies. </p>
<p>CSP&#x2019;s employees should receive security awareness training covering physical security protocols, secure data handling, incident reporting procedures, and emergency response plans. Measures like social engineering awareness, workstation security and safety measures, as well as sensitive data handling practices should be emphasized. The CSP's policies should also address remote work and travel security, ensuring a holistic approach to employee safety.</p>
<p>To meet these responsibilities, the CSP should maintain the following policies and procedures.</p>
<p>Policies should include (but not limited to) provisions on the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Access Control: Requirements for establishing and implementing physical access controls specifically for office spaces, rooms and facilities to ensure that only authorized personnel can enter. Secure methods should be considered such as secure key cards or biometrics for access</li>

Physical and logical assets then should inherit the sensitivity level of the data they handle, hence allowing for the CSP to classify them.</p>
<p>The CSP is responsible for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Providing a secure cloud environment that meets the security requirements of the CSC&#x2019;s data&#x2022;&#xA0;Classifying and documenting the physical and logical assets that are used to compute, store or transmit CSC data, according to the sensitivity levels of such data</li>
  <li>Implementing security controls that are appropriate for the sensitivity level of the CSC data</li>
</ul>
<p>Implementation Guidelines.Applicable to all service models:</p>
<p>CSPs should adhere to a comprehensive approach that aligns with the data sensitivity levels defined by the CSC. This involves understanding the CSC&#x2019;s data classification policy, identifying and assessing the sensitivity of data stored on each asset, implementing appropriate security controls, and continuously monitoring and auditing asset security. </p>
<p>Additionally, CSPs should document asset classification and security controls, train employees, and leverage automated tools to streamline the process and enhance data protection measures. By adopting these best practices, CSPs can effectively safeguard sensitive data and fulfill their contractual responsibilities as trusted partners in the cloud ecosystem.</p>
<p>Implementation best practices for the CSP to classify and document the physical, and logical assets include (but not limited to):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Asset Inventory and Tracking: The CSP should leverage an inventory of all physical and logical assets that are used to store, process, or transmit CSC data (refer to DCS-06), including physical equipment, such as servers and storage devices, as well as software components, such as network assets and configurations, virtual machines, operating systems and applications</li>
  <li>Asset Classification: The CSP should assess the sensitivity of data stored on each asset based on the CSC&#x2019;s data classification policy. This assessment should take into account the type of CSC data, the potential harm that could be caused if the data were breached, and the legal and regulatory requirements for protecting the data</li>
  <li>Automated Tools for Assets Classification: The CSP can use automated tools to help with asset classification and security. These tools can scan assets for vulnerabilities and identify assets that are not in compliance with the asset classification policies</li>
  <li>Assets Classification Documentation: The CSP should document the classification of each asset and the security controls that are applied to the asset. This documentation should be made available to the CSC upon request</li>
  <li>Assets Tagging: The CSPs should assign unique tags or labels to physical and logical assets to facilitate identification, tracking, and management (refer to DCS-06).</li>
  <li>Apply Security Controls: Appropriate classification levels should be applied to physical and logical assets and appropriate security protection and controls in accordance to the sensitivity of the data stored on, processed or transmitted by the cloud asset</li>
  <li>Continuous Monitoring and Evaluation: The CSP should monitor and audit assets security on a regular basis or upon changes to assets to ensure that the security controls applied are effective and appropriate based on the sensitivity levels of CSC data</li>

<p>Implementation Guidelines.The CSC should ensure that its data is properly protected and that the CSP implements appropriate classification and security controls on its physical and logical assets based on the sensitivity of such data.</p>
<p>The following implementation best practices apply for the CSC:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Data Classification Policy: The CSC should develop a comprehensive data classification policy (refer to DSP-01 and DSP-04) that defines the different data sensitivity levels and the criteria for classifying data into those levels. The policy should be communicated to the CSP to guide their asset classification process.</li>
  <li>Data Usage Patterns: Data usage patterns, such as data access frequencies, data flows, and data processing activities could be shared with the CSP. This information can help the CSP understand the context in which your data is used and make informed classification decisions over the physical and logical assets.</li>
  <li>Regulatory Compliance Requirements: The CSP should be informed about applicable legal and regulatory compliance requirements that apply to CSC data, such as industry standards or government regulations. This will ensure that these requirements are taken into account by the CSP when classifying assets and implementing security controls.</li>
  <li>Change Management and Communication: Open communication channels should be maintained with the CSP regarding any changes to physical and logical assets handling CSC data, or any changes to the CSC&#x2019;s data classification policy or usage patterns. This communication will enable the CSP to keep asset classifications and security controls aligned with the CSC&#x2019;s evolving data security and protection requirements.</li>

The responsibility of this control implementation is "Shared Dependent" since the CSP should enable the CSC to access the catalog of CSP assets that are used to compute and store CSC data. The CSC should be empowered to retrieve the list of assets. It should be within the support of the CSP to assign descriptive metadata (tags) to assets for efficient and timely tracking, cost analysis, access control decisions, and alerting (by automation where applicable).</p>
<p>Implementation Guidelines.Applicable to all service models:</p>
<p>The CSP should employ a comprehensive solution (e.g., CMDB) for tracking inventory and managing the physical locations of servers and other data center assets, while phasing out paper-based and manual processes. A hosted asset tracking solution for servers, switches, datacenter asset tracking, and racks usually leverages a combination of technologies, such as passive radio frequency identification (RFID), global positioning system (GPS),  Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and/or Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) with hardware roots-of-trust (HROT).</p>
<p>The CSP should maintain a list of assets the CSC is using (e.g., cloud storage) or has provisioned (e.g., VMs) and provide tools to the CSC to access the CMDB and help it identify and tag the assets that handle CSC data. For instance, the CSP should share information about the assets that are used to store the CSC&#x2019;s data (as well as the means to access them).</p>
<p>This information can then be used by the CSC to catalog, tag, and track all the cloud relevant assets and services that are provided by the CSP, and to process and store CSC data (e.g., network, computational, and storage services).</p>
<p>An EoL (End-of-Life) tracking system for all inventoried assets should be maintained. A process should be established to gather and maintain accurate EoL information for all inventoried assets within the cloud environment (e.g., manufacturer EoL dates for hardware and software, expiration dates for software/services, patch availability timelines). </p>
<p>Automated EoL notifications within the asset inventory system should be implemented to trigger proactive security measures like scheduling asset retirement, migrating workloads, or disabling vulnerable assets nearing their end-of-life. Such notifications should be communicated to the CSC in a timely manner for seamless integration into the CSC&#x2019;s change management framework.</p>
</part>
        <part id="DCS-06_imp_gui_csc" name="item"><title>CSC implementation guidelines</title><prop name="label" value="CSC"/><p>Control Ownership Rationale.The control ownership rationale provided for the CSP applies.</p>
<p>Implementation Guidelines.The CSC should reach out to its CSP to understand what tools it provides (e.g., access to the cloud management plane via catalog managers and APIs) that enable the CSC to retrieve the list of cloud assets that are used to handle the CSC&#x2019;s data.</p>
<p>The CSC should define a tagging strategy for their environment that involves creating a list of tags to categorize assets and asset owners in a catalog. A standardized naming convention is the starting point for organizing the cloud-hosted resources. The same naming conventions on tags should be consistently used across multiple CSPs (e.g., multi-cloud environment), and where possible, cloud assets should be tracked by an automated means, allowing for prompt decisions to be made according to them (e.g., access control decisions, monitoring and alerting, accounting).</p>
<p>Templates for defining a naming and tagging convention for tagging assets are defined by all major CSPs. The CSC may choose to adopt the CSP&#x2019;s naming standards or define their own that they wish to apply to each asset type they plan to deploy as part of their cloud adoption effort.</p>
<p>Examples of tagging conventions and respective cloud assets types that should be cataloged and tracked are below, where applicable by cloud service model (but not limited to):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Asset Tags Types:</li>
  <li>Environment Tag: Identifying resources belonging to different environments such as production, development, or testingii. Function/Application Tag: Associating resources with specific applications or services within the cloud environmentiii. Department Tag: Associating resources with specific departments in the organizationiv. Location Tag: Tagging resources based on their geographic location or data center region</li>
  <li>Owner Tag: Specifying the individual or team responsible for a particular resourcevi. Release Version Tag: Version number of the software or application they are associated withvii. Security Classification Tag:  Identifying the security classification or sensitivity level of resourcesviii. Compliance/Regulatory Tag: Indicate compliance with specific regulations or standardsix. Automation Tag: Indicate whether the asset should be selected for action by scripts, scanners or other form of automation</li>
  <li>Active Tag: Designates resources currently in use for production, development, or other relevant purposesxi. Deprecated Tag: Designates resources scheduled for retirement or no longer actively used</li>
  <li>Cloud Asset Types:</li>
  <li>Virtual machines (e.g., VM instances/images, OS name/version),ii. Virtual networking (e.g., VPC networks and subnets, DNS records, IP addresses),iii. Databases (e.g., database/SQL servers),iv. Storage (e.g., block, file, object storage types), </li>
  <li>Applications (e.g., custom applications, container images, software licenses)</li>
</ol>
<p>The catalog should include all device status changes (e.g., patch levels, lost/decommissioned status, and to whom the asset type is assigned, or approved for BYOD).</p>
<p>Cloud asset cataloging and tracking should be prioritized to include the most security-relevant or critical ones followed by the inclusion of remaining asset types that pertain to minimal or no risk.</p>
<p>If supported by the CSP, automated scans should be made to identify assets that are not tagged or have tagged values not aligned to CSC&#x2019;s tagging rules (e.g., assets tagged or not tagged with a &#x2018;classification level&#x2019; value).</p>
<p>When tagging tools are not made available from the CSP, the CSC should proceed with manually tagging and cataloging assets. Easy-to-parse formats (JSON, YAML, XML) should be preferred for more efficient management and maintenance of the catalog.</p>

<p>Implementation Guidelines.Applicable to all service models:</p>
<p>The CSP should include in its policies and procedures a comprehensive framework for the classification, privacy, protection, and handling of data throughout its lifecycle. This includes clearly defined data storage criteria and secure data disposal practices. The policy should emphasize compliance with relevant regulations, periodic security audits, and continuous monitoring to ensure the security of customer data.</p>
<p>Policies should include (but not limited to) provisions on the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Scope and Objectives: </li>
  <li>The scope and objectives of the policy and what it should achieveii. Formal approval by Executive Management, Leadership Committee (EXCO) and/or Board level membersiii. All the phases of the data/information lifecycle including but not limited to Collection, Creation, Transmission, Storage, Usage, Sharing/Disclosure, Retention/Archival and Destruction  iv. The relevant entities and jurisdictions and/or geographical regions that the organization operates in</li>
  <li>The relevant regulations or applicable industry standards that are applicable to the entity vi. Stakeholders who will be either the owners or custodians/stewards of data (e.g. stakeholders include customers, business partners, third parties, employees)vii. Requirements for communicating the policy to all relevant stakeholders. Communication of policies and procedures can be handled via methods such as electronic digital mailers (EDMs) sent to all staff or via e-learning platformsviii. Alignment to company code, objectives and values (i.e., trust management)</li>
  <li>Data Classification:  Data classification policies and procedures should include the following: </li>
  <li>Data classification and labeling of data with clear definitions and examples (e.g., Public, Internal, Restricted, Confidential)ii. Asset valuation of the asset that could potentially store or process the data (e.g., Asset Valuation Ratings such as High, Medium, and Low mapped against Confidentiality, Integrity; availability and impacts such as Financial, Reputational, Customer Service, Operational, and Regulatory. The ratings should be decided based on the label applicable to the data/dataset and the overall risk it represents) (refer to DCS-05)iii. Acceptable Use Agreements (AUAs) should be communicated and signed by all relevant stakeholders, especially before employee/personal onboarding. The AUA should be a declaration that confirms awareness and willingness to protect dataiv. Technologies that either label data/information automatically at various layers of the infrastructure (e.g., email gateway, end Point) or allow an end user to specifically choose classification should be considered for implementation</li>
  <li>Data and asset classification should occur before a technology asset or service is being designed and is eventually placed into production. An asset value rating should be assigned to every asset in the inventoryvi. All data and its associated assets should be accounted for (i.e., a Data and asset inventory should exist)vii. A Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed (RACI) matrix that specifies the task of each role or individual that will act as either data owner, steward/custodian or processorviii. Data flow diagrams should be available to understand how specific data elements flow through the ecosystem and where they are stored and/or processed</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: From a control implementation perspective, the CSP should offer Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) solutions that are able to classify and label data based on known regulations (e.g., HIPAA, PCI-DSS) or custom rules (e.g., financial or proprietary data), and DLP.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Data Privacy:  Data Privacy policies and procedures should include the following: </li>
  <li>Data minimization, specifically during the collection of data for the purposes of ensuring alignment to privacy regulationsii. Privacy notices covering what data will be collected, how it will be used, who will have access to the data, with whom it will be shared or disclosed (including third parties), how long it will be retained, and how it will be protected. From an implementation perspective, privacy notices can take the form of pop-ups, banners, layered notices, or similariii. Additional concepts such as Consent, Choice, Collection Limitations, Data Quality, Reliable Sources, Primary &amp; Secondary Uses, and Internal and External Disclosureiv. Data subject access and under what conditions it will be provided (i.e., how data subjects can access and/or export their data and how they can contact the organization with questions or concerns around privacy)</li>
  <li>Data Handling &amp; Protection:  Data handling &amp; protection policies and procedures should include the following: </li>
  <li>Data protection controls should be commensurate with the classification of data, its associated label, and the overall value of the asset that stores or processes the data (where required approvals are taken), including and not limited to all types of data (e.g., personal data, sensitive data)ii. Logical controls including but not limited to encryption of data in storage &amp; in transit, use of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) for data in use, authentication, authorization (access control and permissions), audit trails, digital rights management (DRM), data leak prevention (DLP), outbound proxy, SSL/TLS bypass, database access management (DAM), anonymization, tokenization, and pseudonymization.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: types of encryption, algorithms, key sizes, and key management should be referenced in the Cryptography, Encryption &amp; Key Management domain of the CCM.</p>
<p>iii. Physical controls including but not limited to the physical access controls such as locks and keys, biometrics, smart cards, and mandatory dual control for opening fireproof safesiv. Environmental controls including but not limited to protection against extreme temperatures, humidity, fire, and other acts of nature</p>

<ol>
  <li>Additional controls including but not limited to protection against acts of war (e.g., terrorism, biological or chemical warfare)vi. Data handling controls for all types of data, hard copies and/or digitalvii. Protection of data on different types of devices including but not limited to end points, servers, mobile devices, removable (e.g., USB drives, SD cards) and backup media (e.g., encryption of backup tapes) viii. Business Continuity and disaster recovery measures that will ensure confidentiality, integrity and availability of data (e.g., the use of special air-gapped vaults to recover from ransomware attacks, tapes off site, recovery from hot, warm, or cold sites, and regular recovery testing)ix. Approach to external security testing, vulnerability assessment and certifications</li>
  <li>Approach to risk management and shared responsibilitiesxi. Approach to manage security incidents and data breach notifications.</li>
  <li>Data Storage &amp; Retention: Data Storage &amp; Retention policies and procedures should include the following: </li>
  <li>The length/period of time the data will be retained as per laws, regulations and business requirementsii. Type of data including but not limited to customer data, backups, audit logs, and any data that can assist with forensic investigationsiii. Requirements to collect and retain evidence, hardcopy records, monitoring, and recording mechanismsiv. Handling chain of custody which includes prevention of manipulation of records</li>
  <li>Be aligned with the organization&#x2019;s topic-specific policy on records management and other records requirementsvi. Be chosen such that required records can be retrieved in an acceptable time frame and format, depending on the requirements to be fulfilled vii. Storage and handling procedures are implemented in accordance with recommendations provided by manufacturers of storage media. Consideration should be given to the possibility of deterioration of media used for storage of recordsviii. Handling of metadata describing the context, content and structure of records, as well as their management over time</li>
  <li>Data Destruction: Data Destruction policies and procedures should include the following: </li>
  <li>The conditions under which data will be destroyed including but not limited to termination of service by the CSC, automatic deletion after a specific period (e.g., 30 days) where applicable or when requested by the CSC or storage device has reached end of lifeii. The specific methods that will be used to destroy data (e.g., cryptographic erasure, writing zeros, degaussing, physical destruction or as per media sanitization guidelines)</li>
  <li>Approval: Approval requirements and senior management involvement to ensure alignment with the organization's strategic goals and risk appetite</li>
  <li>An approval process should be established for any changes or modifications to the policy and proceduresii. A documented record of approvals (including dates, names of approvers, and any relevant comments or discussions) should be maintained</li>
  <li>Communication: Effective communication of the policy and procedures should be facilitated to all relevant cloud stakeholders</li>
  <li>Maintenance and Reviews: Policies and procedures for the classification, protection and handling of data should be documented, reviewed and updated at least annually to ensure alignment with evolving cloud security landscape and to reflect changes in cloud technology, regulations, and risks</li>

Independent, because the documentation can be created without dependency of the CSP on the CSC and vice-versa.</p>
<p>Implementation Guidelines.Applicable to all service models:</p>
<p>Data Flow Diagram (DFD) documentation should consist of a visual representation of the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>At a minimum, it should highlight where sensitive data (e.g. data labeled as personal data, Top Secret, Secret, Restricted or Internal) is processed, stored and transmitted. </li>
  <li>Sources* (typically where a connection originates from) , destinations* (typically where a connection terminates), subjects **(users, systems/assets, or processes), and objects (systems/assets, or processes). Since subjects or objects could include technology components (aka systems or assets) where the data will either be stored, processed or transmitted, a recommended way of depicting them effectively is to maintain the balance of the detail of components shown, such that it is easily understood by most audiences, technical or non-technical (e.g., by naming the technologies in use)</li>
  <li>arrows which indicate whether the communication is one way or two way</li>
  <li>how data moves between sources, destinations, subjects and objects. One recommended method of depicting this is by using numbers that indicate the sequential flow of information (e.g., 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4)  and combining that with arrows indicating which specific way the data is actually flowing. It is also recommended to implement application stack maps to understand where data will reside in order to factor in geographic differences in monitoring and data capture</li>
  <li>where required and necessary, additional information*** such as type of operations on the data (e.g., read vs. read/write), protocols used to transmit data (e.g. HTTP, SMTP, REST), port numbers (e.g.. 443, 80), and boundaries highlighting the isolation between internal and external networks (e.g., public internet vs backend database) should be included</li>
  <li>use of wireframes to structure a journey is also a popular method used to explain data flows</li>
  <li>various stages of the data lifecycle from creation, use, sharing, archival to destruction</li>
  <li>DFD documentation should be reviewed and updated at least once annually or when key changes take place on where the data is stored, processed or transmitted, or if the classification of the data changes (e.g., an asset that was earlier not storing sensitive personal data, will now begin storing such data)</li>
  <li>DFD should documentation be ready and completed at the system design stage of the SDLC. This approach has a higher probability of the high level design (HLD) being more comprehensive, completed, and implementable</li>
  <li>where possible, the CSP and CSC should work with the systems engineering team to design a systems logical design (SLD) showing all system component servers (e.g., web, application, Windows, database, network, SAN, Internet ) and the data flows, then review with all parties involved for final design and implementation</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Examples include (but are not limited to):</li>
  <li>systems exposed to the entire world (i.e., exposed to 0.0.0.0) </li>
  <li>systems exposed to a limited audience / number of systems (e.g., exposed to a group of beta customer devices only)</li>
  <li>systems exposed to business partners </li>
  <li>systems exposed to 3rd parties</li>
</ul>
<p>** Examples include (but are not limited to):</p>

<ul>
  <li>customers</li>
  <li>business partners</li>
  <li>vendors</li>
  <li>3rd parties</li>
  <li>the general public </li>
</ul>
<p>*** Typically, DFDs do not detail lower level network components like routers or switches. That said, it is possible that other components such as firewalls, Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) , File Scanning &amp; Sandboxing systems , content delivery networks (CDN), or more are part of DFDs; these should be included where required and necessary. </p>

<p>Implementation Guidelines.Applicable to all service models:</p>

<ol>
  <li>before security- and privacy-design-activities begin, the data and asset inventory, data classification and asset valuation, and DFD documentation and HLD, at a minimum should be completed. This is recommended as a prerequisite to ensure that the security or privacy controls that are designed are commensurate with the value of the data, and the associated asset and can be executed in an efficient manner; decisions on baking in security and privacy controls are based on complete and accurate information available at hand</li>
  <li>security-by-design and privacy-by-design activities should begin with examining DFD and the HLD documentation, at a minimum. Where possible and if available, Low Level Design (LLDs) should also be reviewed</li>
  <li>As part of the activity, threat modeling should be conducted to envision which specific threat actors (the who, e.g., script kiddies, hacktivists, criminals, nation states) could attack a specific asset, their motives (e.g., money, political, espionage), and what specific threats (the method via which they could attack and what weaknesses they could exploit) pose to an asset's  or data's security and/or privacy. Threat modeling can be performed using approaches or frameworks such as STRIDE, DREAD, PASTA, or similar. If agile methodologies such as scrum or Kanban are being used within the organization, threat modeling can be conducted by documenting evil stories or misuse cases for every user story produced during a sprint. It is also recommended to create threat modeling diagrams that visually depict the concept of trust boundaries, isolation, threats affecting each asset, and recommended countermeasures. Threats can be classified into people, process, or technology</li>
  <li>post threat modeling, a comprehensive security pattern* detailing the security requirements, should be created. Security requirements should consider threats identified, potential weaknesses, regulatory requirements, and recommend countermeasures that lead to prevention, detection, response or recovery of an asset that will store, process. or transmit data. NIST's Identify, Protect, Detect, Response, and Recovery model is sometimes applied as a recommended baseline</li>
  <li>security requirements should be created for all stages of the SDLC,  from feasibility study to design to build to run (operationalize) to maintenance</li>
  <li>security requirements should be created for every component in the design; this includes but is not limited to all technology assets in scope of the design and network connectivity between those assets</li>
  <li>security requirements should cover scenarios that involve people (e.g., user education, customer education), process (e.g., customer registration for a mobile banking app via multiple authentication methods such as face verification and a one-time code sent via email the first time) and Technology (e.g., mutual TLS for all APIs that connect to third parties)</li>
  <li>security requirements some of which may also apply to privacy should include but not be limited to Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) for DAM. </li>
</ol>
<p>Note: AAA concepts are also covered via identity and access management security requirements that cover concepts such as MFA, role based or attribute based access control (RBAC/ABAC), conditional access policies, and privileged access management (PAM)</p>

<ol>
  <li>application security (e.g., alignment to ASVS for web, mobile application security verification standard MASVS, OWASP Top 10 API, and OWASP Top 10 for CI/CD</li>
  <li>infrastructure security (e.g., hardening of technology assets based on industry standard benchmarks)</li>
  <li>network security (e.g., security of data in transit, use of mutual TLS, versions of TLS and recommended ciphers)ii. encryption of data at rest using concepts such as transparent data encryption (TDE), volume-based encryption or storage-based encryption, format-preserving encryption (FPE), and order-preserving encryption should be considered. iii. Logging &amp; Monitoring (refer to LOG domain)iv. Incident Response &amp; Forensics (refer to SEF domain)</li>
  <li>Business Continuity &amp; Disaster Recovery (refer to BCR domain)</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: Encryption is also a key privacy by design control. It has not been stated in the privacy by design section on purpose, in order to avoid duplication. The recommendations mentioned here apply to both DSP-07 &amp; DSP - 08</p>

<ol>
  <li>Security  controls should be baked into every phase of the data lifecycle, from creation to use to sharing to archival to destruction</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Security patterns are documented approaches that define security requirements that can be used in a repeatable manner for the same or similar use cases. </li>

  <li>Privacy requirements should be created for every component in the design; this includes but is not limited to all technology assets in scope of the design &amp; network connectivity between those assets</li>
  <li>Privacy requirements should cover scenarios that involve People (e.g. user education, customer education), Process (e.g. how will authorized business stakeholders access data subject to privacy regulations) &amp; Technology (e.g. All JSON Web Tokens should contain a Scope section that ensures that every operation on data requires Authentication &amp; Authorization from the Data subject)</li>
  <li>Privacy by design requirements should ensure that they align with regulatory requirements in the respective jurisdiction of the organization. </li>
</ol>
<p>Recommended privacy by design requirements include (but are not limited to):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Data Minimization, specifically during the collection of data for the purposes of ensuring alignment to privacy regulations</li>
  <li>Privacy notices covering what data will be collected, how it will be used, who will have access to the data, with whom it will be shared or disclosed (including 3rd parties), how long it will be retained, how it will be protected,. From an implementation perspective, privacy notices can take the form of Pop-Ups, banners, layered notices or similar</li>
  <li>Additional concepts such as Consent, Choice, Collection Limitations, Data Quality, Reliable Sources, Primary &amp; Secondary Uses, Internal &amp; External Disclosure</li>
  <li>Data Subject Access and under what conditions it will be provided (e.g. how data subjects can access and/or export their data and how they can contact the CSP with questions or concerns around privacy)</li>
  <li>Technologies that deploy Privacy Enhancing Techniques (PET) such as Non-Perturbation (e.g. Masking, Suppression, Generalisation or Pseudonymisation), Perturbation (e.g., Noise Addition or Micro Aggregation) , Cryptography (e.g. Encryption techniques such as Homomorphic, Format Preserving, Deterministic, Order-Preserving) and Privacy Models such as k-anonymity, I-diversity or similar</li>
  <li>Rules around how data will be protected during Cross Border transfers should be considered based on regulatory requirements</li>
  <li>The default/out-of-the-box settings should align with the applicable regional privacy regulations. Examples include but are not limited to the following: </li>
  <li>explicit consent/choice based manual opt-in, wherein the data subject should manually tick a box or perform some action to explicitly consent, should be the privacy by default option available as opposed to automatic opt-in, which then requires manual opt-out by a data subject </li>
  <li>Regarding cookies, only strictly necessary ones should be auto-enabled, while additional cookies of other types should be auto-disabled. Explicit consent from the data subject should be requested in the event additional cookies (other than strictly necessary cookies) need to be enabled</li>
  <li>Enabled by default, graphical user interfaces (GUI) should conduct data collection (e.g., via a web form) by requesting only the absolute minimum data required (e.g., if only age range is required based on legitimate use principles, specific age should not be available in the drop down menu) aka data minimization</li>
  <li>by default, privacy notices (either simple or layered) should be displayed each and every time information is requested from the data subject</li>
  <li>CSPs should ensure that MSAs with their respective sub-contractors or dependent parties contain the requisite data privacy clauses (e.g., data breach notification clauses such as "The CSP should inform the CSC of a data breach within a reasonable timeframe/with immediacy as per required regulations or based on instruction from the CSC&#x201D; (e.g., if the CSC is the data controller)</li>

Contracts, SLAs, and vendor internal policies should be reviewed to manage risks associated with security, availability, and confidentiality involving third parties.</li>
  <li>Requirements should be specified for customers, suppliers, and third parties in contract terms to implement appropriate safeguards such as:</li>
  <li>access restrictions to protect information from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure (i.e., authorize its employees, contractors, and sub-processors to access customer data only as strictly necessary to comply with Instructions)ii. take appropriate steps to ensure compliance with the security measures by its employees, contractors and sub-processors to the extent applicable to their scope of performance, and to ensure that all persons authorized to process customer data are under an obligation of confidentialityiii. use TLS to protect data when in transit between the cloud services and the CSC.

<ol>
  <li>the CSP should publish a privacy statement and explain its processes for handling sensitive data. This should be official, signed, legally valid, and issued pursuant to federal or local law and rules. Some of the attributes to be covered in the process are:</li>
  <li>important definitions such as &#x201C;personal data&#x201D;, &#x201C;data subject&#x201D;, &#x201C;processing&#x201D;, &#x201C;controller&#x201D; and &#x201C;processor,&#x201D; etc.ii. scope of data protection lawiii. roles and responsibilities of processor, controller and customeriv. scope of processing, such as it only collects and stores the customer&#x2019;s user credentials, which includes: first name, last name, username, and password. Do not store, process, or transmit sensitive data like birthdate, personal address, social security number, health information, financial data (SOX) or credit card information</li>
  <li>data deletion: deletion by customer, return or deletion when term ends, deferred deletion instructionvi. security measures, controls and assistance: Access and compliance, encryption, use of unique encryption keys for each customer to ensure that customer data is logically separated within the service, data in production is completely segmented from the development, testing, staging, and corporate environments. Use of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) for data in use, No customer production data is used in test or development environments. If it is deemed absolutely necessary to use Production Data for the purposes of Testing, then controls that are exactly the same as the Production environment must be applied and replicated.vii. all virtual machine instances within the production environment are allow-listed to only communicate with each other on specific ports and protocols, implement IDS/IPS and strict firewalling at the hypervisor and guest instance layers, no outbound communication is permitted that originates from the production environment, network layer controls ensure that privileged access is always enforced through allow-listed IPs and hosts, using encrypted VPN tunnels through non-standard ports, technical operations personnel are assigned an SSH key pair to authenticate to the production environment, second-factor authentication is provided by a physically separate hardware MFA token, implementation of transaction monitoring on the databases to detect abnormal queries or large exports of customer data, monitoring all outbound traffic from the CSP's production environment for anomalies using both proprietary and commercial traffic monitoring and intrusion detection systems, sending alerts to both technical operations and security, do not store customer data outside of the service's production environment, and do not permit the exporting of customer data onto removable media or mobile devices, datacenter security, networks and transmission, and personnel securityviii. data incident managementix. customer&#x2019;s security responsibilities </li>
  <li>compliance certifications and SOC reportsxi. customer&#x2019;s audit rightsxii. access etc.; data subject rights; data exportxiii. data transfersxiv. use of sub-processors</li>
  <li>where and when applicable, the CSP should implement Information rights management technology for all sensitive data</li>
  <li>the CSP should require a subpoena or its equivalent before disclosing non-content, and only disclose content to law enforcement in response to a warrant (or its local equivalent)</li>
  <li>the CSP should redirect the government and other regulatory authorities to seek data from the CSC itself when legally permitted</li>
  <li>the CSP should establish a process to capture all law enforcement requests through a secure portal, for which only vetted law enforcement agencies receive access. Once the CSP reviews the demand and determines that it should provide data, the data specified in the valid legal order should be provided to law enforcement through the same secure portal</li>
  <li>the CSP should design an acceptable use policy (AUP) for systems and resources to help its employees, suppliers, contractors and partners protect the security and integrity of information and its systems and resources, and specify on how they may, and may not, use systems and resources while performing their job duties</li>

In cases of shared tenancy, the CSC should be allowed to request the physical location of customer data. </p>
<p>Implementation Guidelines.Applicable to all service models:</p>
<p>This control implementation is not service delivery model specific (IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS). Irrespective of cloud service delivery model, the CSP is responsible to define and implement, processes, procedures and technical measures for storing, processing and backing up data in accordance with the requirement specified in the contract with CSC.</p>
<p>Recommendations to the CSP are: </p>

<ol>
  <li>maintain a policy that defines the requirement to identify, classify, and record attributes for all assets (i.e., server hardware, software, data held on information systems, and information needed for disaster recovery and business continuity purposes). All assets should be tracked in an inventory system in accordance with the policy. Owner, classification, location should be identified and tracked in the asset tracking system. The inventory of assets should be reviewed at least on a quarterly basis to make sure each asset is protected in accordance with its classification, and to verify that the data inventory is accurate</li>
  <li>require the CSC to specify the particular geography where its data will be stored. The CSP should ensure that data is replicated only within a selected geographic area or region for redundancy. Data should not be replicated outside of a specified geography without first notifying the CSC, unless required by law</li>
  <li>design and architect low latency and highly available geographically dispersed storage services such as clustering, and provide replication to backup system software and data it is available with minimum loss</li>
  <li>provide services and tools to configure access, encryption, and logging features to help the CSC manage its operations effectively. The CSP should provide the CSC with the option to manage its own encryption keys</li>
  <li>not access or use customer content for any purpose other than as legally required and for maintaining the services provided to the the CSC</li>
  <li>not access any unencrypted data being transmitted, processed, or stored on the systems that run in their data centers which are geotagged. Data stored as synchronous replicas across different availability zones and regions, and the associated services, should be designed to recover quickly from availability zone and regional data failures</li>
  <li>as part of the vendor risk management program, audit its data centers yearly and review / maintain copies of attestation reports such as SOC2 Type 2</li>

<p>This control&#x2019;s implementation responsibility is &#x201C;Shared&#x201D; because both the CSP and the CSC each need to have their own respective Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) programs to cover their operations, products, and services, and the establishment of such a program is fully internal and unique to each organization, including the associated policies and procedures. The CSP and the CSC each independently establish their own respective policies and procedures for these functions. Because the GRC program is an organizational-level function, the Shared (Independent) ownership of this control applies irrespective of the types of cloud services provided or consumed.</p>
<p>Implementation Guidelines.Applicable to all service models:</p>
<p>Establishing robust policies and procedures for an information governance program is paramount for CSPs and CSCs in the context of cloud computing and security. </p>
<p>A well-defined Risk Management Program ensures that potential threats and vulnerabilities associated with cloud services are systematically identified, assessed, and mitigated, reducing the likelihood of security breaches. Organizational policies and procedures contribute to the clarity and consistency of operations, ensuring that all stakeholders, including CSCs, adhere to established standards and regulatory requirements. A policy should be mapped with the organization's governing mission as its focus and should always remain up-to-date with the direction and needs of the organization.</p>
<p>The implementation of an Information Security Program aids CSPs safeguarding sensitive data, as it delineates encryption standards, access controls, and incident response plans, fortifying the overall security posture. These policies collectively form the cornerstone of a resilient information governance framework, instilling confidence in both CSPs and CSC by addressing risks, ensuring compliance, and enhancing overall cloud security.</p>
<p>Both the CSP and CSC should have a robust governance program in place. Top leadership is ultimately responsible for ensuring the program is properly implemented. A core element of governance is that the people tasked with it should have the authority to enforce it.</p>
<p>The CSP and CSC each have their own business needs and requirements for policies and procedures. These should cover the main security objectives of the cloud organization, the rationale for these objectives, approvals, and the review process. Policies should also delineate roles and responsibilities within the cloud organization, stating who should do what, where, when and how. </p>
<p>Policies should include (but not limited to) provisions on the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Scope and Objectives: A comprehensive information governance program should be established to effectively manage and protect the organization's information assets, supporting business objectives, complying with applicable regulations. The scope of the information governance program should be defined, specifying the types of information covered, the organizational units involved, and the geographic locations where the program applies. The scope should include (but not limited to):</li>
  <li>all relevant information assets, including data, documents, records, and intellectual property.ii. the ownership and custodianship of information assetsiii. the appropriate lifecycle management for information assets, including creation, storage, access, retention, and disposaliv. guidelines for handling sensitive information, such as personal data and protected health information (PHI)</li>
  <li>Risk Management Program: A risk management framework that aligns with the organization's overall risk appetite and business objectives should be established. The ERM should:</li>
  <li>Identify, assess, and prioritize cloud-related risks, including data security, privacy, compliance, and operational risksii. Implement appropriate risk mitigation strategies, such as data encryption, access controls, and regular security auditsiii. Continuously monitor and evaluate cloud-related risks and adapt risk mitigation strategies as needed</li>
  <li>Organizational Policy Reviews: Organizational policies and procedures should be regularly reviewed and updated to ensure they remain aligned with the organization's evolving business needs and regulatory requirements.</li>
  <li>Policy Exception Process: a formal policy exception process should be established that is transparent, accountable, and auditable</li>
  <li>criteria for approving policy exceptions should be defined, ensuring that exceptions are granted only in emergencies and/or under well justified circumstanceii. senior management approval should be required for all policy exceptionsiii. all policy exceptions should be documented and tracked, including the rationale for approval and the mitigating measures implemented</li>
  <li>Information Security Program: An information security program should be implemented that aligns with industry best practices and relevant regulatory requirements, and includes all relevant domains of the latest up to date version of the Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM)</li>
  <li>Governance Responsibility Model: Roles and responsibilities for planning, implementing, operating, assessing, and improving cloud governance programs should be defined.</li>
  <li>Establish a governance committee or steering group with representatives from various departments, including IT, legal, compliance, and risk managementii. Specific responsibilities should be delegated to individual teams or roles, ensuring that accountability is assigned and documentediii. Regular training should be provided to all stakeholders on their governance responsibilities</li>
  <li>Information System Regulatory Mapping: all relevant standards, regulations, legal/contractual, and statutory requirements that apply to cloud-based information systems should be identified and documented. A regulatory mapping registry should be maintained that is regularly updated to reflect changes in regulatory requirements.</li>
  <li>Special Interest Groups: relationships with relevant cloud-related special interest groups, industry organizations, and government agencies should be established and maintained</li>
  <li>Participate in industry forums, conferences, and workshops to stay up-to-date on emerging cloud technologies, trends, and regulatory developmentsii. Share best practices and insights with other cloud organizations through industry forums and publicationsiii. Collaborate with cloud industry experts to address common cloud-related challenges and develop innovative solutions</li>
  <li>Approval: Approval requirements and senior management involvement to ensure alignment with the organization's strategic goals and risk appetite</li>
  <li>An approval process should be established for any changes or modifications to the policy and proceduresii. A documented record of approvals (including dates, names of approvers, and any relevant comments or discussions) should be maintained</li>
  <li>Communication: Effective communication of the policy and procedures should be facilitated to all relevant cloud stakeholders</li>
  <li>Maintenance and Reviews: Information governance policies and procedures should be documented, reviewed and updated at least annually to ensure alignment with evolving cloud security landscape and to reflect changes in cloud technology, regulations, and risks</li>

The CSP and the CSC each independently establish their own respective policies and procedures for identification, evaluation, ownership, treatment, and acceptance of risks, including those pertaining to cloud security and privacy risks. Risk management for an organization is ultimately owned by that organization's leadership.</p>
<p>An ERM program, as with all Governance and Risk Compliance (GRC) topics, should be implemented at the organizational level and should be independent of the type of cloud service delivery model and irrespective of the types of cloud services provided or consumed. Cloud organizations, whether operating in a cloud service consumption or cloud service provider role, need to appropriately manage risk, and to establish a formal, documented, leadership-sponsored Enterprise Risk Management program.</p>
<p>Implementation Guidelines.Applicable to all service models:</p>
<p>Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) is the overall management of risk for an organization. The service agreement or contract defines important elements such as the scope of services, service levels, responsibilities and obligations, among others, between a CSP and a CSC. While the contract may or may not define roles and responsibilities in detail, and may not address responsibilities for risk management, an entity can never fully outsource its ultimate responsibility and accountability for risk management to an external provider. The purpose of risk management is the creation and protection of value. The risk management process involves the systematic application of policies, procedures, and practices to the activities of communicating and consulting, establishing the context and assessing, treating, monitoring, reviewing, recording, and reporting risk. Risk for the CSP should be calculated using a risk appetite framework that defines the risk capacity or the maximum amount of residual risk it will accept after controls and other measures have been put in place.</p>
<p>The risk management process should be an integral part of management and decision-making and integrated into the structure, operations and processes of the organization. It can be applied at strategic, operational, program, or project levels. There can be many applications of the risk management process within an organization, customized to achieve objectives and to suit the external and internal context in which they are applied. As part of the ERP program, the Information security risk management process should exist. </p>
<p>The Information security risk management should also include cloud-relevant information security and data privacy risks when applicable to the organization. </p>
<p>The CSP and CSP should both have information security risk management processes in place. They are advised to align to the STAR Program and other widely known cyber/cloud security frameworks and standards</p>
<p>If the CSP uses the services of other providers,, it should ensure information security levels to the CSC are maintained or exceeded. When the CSP provides services based on a supply chain, the CSP should provide information security objectives to suppliers, and request that each of the suppliers perform risk management activities to achieve the objectives</p>

<p>The implementation guidelines provided for the CSP apply.</p>
<p>Also, the information security risk management should include cloud-relevant information security and data privacy risk when applicable. </p>
<p>When using the CSP, the CSC accepts some responsibility for certain risks, and it has the final responsibility of managing those risks (accept, mitigate, transfer). The CSC should define their risk appetite and risk tolerance to be able to manage the risk correctly. The CSC should review the CSP's documentation to be able to hold an effective risk position.</p>

<p>Implementation Guidelines.Applicable to all service models:</p>
<p>The CSP bears the responsibility for fostering a security culture within its organization, safeguarding itself and its clients from both accidental and malicious activities.</p>
<p>A clear desk policy is a fundamental component of information security, ensuring the physical protection of sensitive data from theft. This policy mandates the secure storage of assets in designated furniture, safes, and lockers, effectively shielding sensitive information from unauthorized access. Additionally, it safeguards against overlooking, shoulder surfing, and potential malicious activity by enforcing screen locks, thereby reducing the risk of session capturing, particularly in virtualized environments.</p>
<p>To further enhance security, whiteboards, writable walls, and other writable surfaces, along with notebooks, post-it notes, and similar materials, should be cleared, securely shredded, or wiped clean when not in use. Mobile devices and desktops may be equipped with physical cable locks to prevent theft, while servers and sensitive equipment should be stored within secured racks or cages.</p>
<p>When sending documents to printers, then these documents should be retrieved promptly to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.</p>
<p>Policies should include (but not limited to) provisions on the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Scope and Objectives: This policy applies to all workspaces, including physical workstations, laptops, mobile devices, and cloud-based workspaces in order to protect data confidentiality and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information for all employees, contractors, and third parties that leave their workspaces unattended</li>
  <li>Screen Locking Mechanism:</li>
  <li>Require all devices to have an automatic screen locking mechanism that activates after a defined period of inactivity (e.g., not exceeding five minutes)ii. Require strong passwords, PIN, or biometric authentication to unlock screens (refer to IAM-02)iii. Implement two-factor authentication (2FA) for all users to further enhance screen lock security</li>
  <li>Automatic Logout:</li>
  <li>Implement an automatic session logout feature after a specified period of inactivity to ensure that users are not inadvertently leaving their sessions openii. automatically lock remote desktop sessions when not in use, and require secure authentication for re-entry</li>
  <li>Privacy Screens: Encourage or require the use of privacy screens on devices to limit the visibility of screens to individuals in close proximity</li>
  <li>Clear Desk Policy: employees should maintain a clean workspace, ensuring that confidential information is not openly visible when they are away from their desks. Document covers or lockable storage cabinets for sensitive documents are advised</li>
  <li>confidential documents, printouts, or notes should be not left in plain sightii. confidential documents should be shred or securely disposed of when no longer needed (refer to DSP-02)</li>
  <li>Secure Physical Devices:</li>
  <li>Lock workstations, laptops, and mobile devices when left unattended, even for short periodsii. Use strong passwords and enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all devicesiii. Avoid storing confidential data on removable media, such as USB drives, unless encrypted</li>
  <li>Approval: Approval requirements and senior management involvement to ensure alignment with the organization's strategic goals and risk appetite</li>

The controls however are Independent from one another. Both entities may have different Remote and Home Working policies and Procedures which will link to the individual organizations standards and requirements within their policies and processes that they should achieve for their respective countries , contractual or regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>Implementation Guidelines.Applicable to all service models:</p>
<p>Remote and Home working policy should be deployed by the CSP where it permits those activities for its personnel. Remote working increases the risk and threat profile of a cloud organization as these boundaries of protection may become weakened or assets may be compromised through various means. The CSP has a responsibility to protect its core systems and its CSC's data. The policy should be defined and deployed to provide its personnel the appropriate security requirements, controls and procedures to follow while they work remotely.</p>
<p>Personnel should be trained and informed of risks when working remotely, as the shift to a decentralized work environment introduces various cybersecurity threats that individuals must be vigilant against. </p>
<p>One prevalent risk is the increased susceptibility to phishing attacks. Additionally, the use of unsecured Wi-Fi networks in home environments poses a potential threat, as it opens avenues for unauthorized access and data interception. Remote workers should also be cautious about the security of their devices, as the loss or theft of laptops or mobile devices can lead to unauthorized access to corporate data. Furthermore, the reliance on personal devices and unsecured applications for work tasks may expose organizations to data breaches and compromise the confidentiality of sensitive information. </p>
<p>Policies should include (but not limited to) provisions on the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Scope and Objectives: This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who access, process, or store information accessed, processed or stored at remote sites and locations in the context of cloud computing and cloud security. Objective of policy is to ensure that remote employees are aware of and comply with the organization's cloud security policies and procedures</li>
  <li>Secure Network Connections: Require the use of a VPN for secure and encrypted communication, with strong encryption protocols and authentication mechanisms, between remote devices and the corporate network</li>
  <li>Remote Working MFA Access: Require the use of MFA for accessing corporate systems and cloud services. The use of MFA on all devices and applications to add an extra layer of security should be encouraged</li>
  <li>Endpoints Protection: Require the deployment of endpoint protection software to detect and prevent malware and other security threats</li>
  <li>Implement Mobile Device Management (MDM) or Endpoint Management solutions for remote device configuration, monitoring, and security enforcement (e.g., anti-malware, device encryption, secure email, etc.) (refer to UEM domain)ii. Educate remote workers about the risks of using public Wi-Fi and recommend the use of a VPN when connecting to public networksiii. Provide guidelines for securing home Wi-Fi networks, including the use of strong encryption (WPA3) and changing default credentials</li>
  <li>Secure Remote Desktop Solutions: Where applicable, require the use secure remote desktop solutions with strong encryption and authentication</li>
  <li>Secure File Transfer: Discourage the use of personal email accounts or insecure file-sharing services for work-related tasks</li>
  <li>Regular Software Updates: Enable automatic updates whenever possible and educate users on the importance of keeping software up to date</li>
  <li>Remote Data Backups: Require regular backups of critical data stored on remote devices and test data restoration procedures periodically to ensure data can be recovered in case of loss or a security incident</li>
  <li>Secure File Transfer: Discourage the use of personal email accounts or insecure file-sharing services for work-related tasks.</li>
  <li>Secure Printing: Educate remote workers with secure printing practices, such as immediately retrieving printed documents with sensitive data</li>
  <li>Approval: Approval requirements and senior management involvement to ensure alignment with the organization's strategic goals and risk appetite</li>
  <li>An approval process should be established for any changes or modifications to the policy and proceduresii. A documented record of approvals (including dates, names of approvers, and any relevant comments or discussions) should be maintained</li>
  <li>Communication: Effective communication of the policy and procedures should be facilitated to all relevant cloud stakeholders</li>
  <li>Maintenance and Reviews: Remote working policies and procedures should be documented, reviewed and updated at least annually to ensure alignment with evolving cloud security landscape and to reflect changes in cloud technology, regulations, and risks</li>

<p>Implementation best practices for CSPs to effectively employ SoD include (but are not limited to):</p>

<ol>
  <li>SoD Role Management and Access:  </li>
  <li>A centralized role management system should be implemented to oversee and maintain role permissionsii. Roles overlapping in responsibilities should be minimized to enhance SoDiii. Roles should be created with specific permissions for different functions within the cloud environment in this way avoiding assigning a single identity with excessive privileges that could enable unauthorized actions (e.g., critical functions, such as authorization, approval, and execution, should be separated among different identities)iv. Access levels should be segregated to restrict roles and their access to specific portions of the cloud environment </li>
  <li>For high-risk or critical activities, such as approving transactions or making modifications to sensitive data, a multi-level approval process should be implemented (i.e., multiple individuals from different roles approve an action)</li>
  <li>Role Assignment and Provisioning: Tools should be utilized (automated where possible) to assign and manage user roles based on job roles and required access levels</li>
  <li>Roles Reviews: Regular reviews should be conducted of role definitions and their permissions to minimize the risk of conflicting duties and to ensure they align with current business needs and maintain adequate separation of duties</li>
  <li>Role Changes Monitoring: Monitoring and logging mechanisms should be implemented to track changes to identity roles and permissions</li>
  <li>Roles Exception Management: An exception management process should be established for cases where multiple roles must be granted to a single user. This should require approval from senior management and documented justification</li>
  <li>Violations Reporting: Reporting procedures should be defined for suspected or confirmed SoD violations</li>
  <li>SoD Controls Monitoring: SoD controls should be regularly assessed to ensure their effectiveness and address any gaps or vulnerabilities</li>

<p>Implementation best practices for CSPs to effectively employ the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) include (but are not limited to):</p>

<ol>
  <li>LP Infrastructure: The cloud infrastructure should be designed and configured with PoLP in mind by limiting the privileges of identities to the bare minimum required for their operation</li>
  <li>LP Roles and Permissions: Specific actions, data, and resources each role is required to access to perform their duties should be identified in order to determine the appropriate level of access based for each role/identity (RBAC should be utilized to enforce access control permissions)</li>
  <li>LP Access of Administrative Accounts: </li>
  <li>Administrative accounts (e.g., root or administrator accounts) should have the most restrictive access that is limited to specific tasks and environments, and ensured that they are only used when absolutely necessaryii. MFA should be enforced for all administrative accounts and any other high-risk access points</li>
  <li>Sensitive Data Access Limitation: Access to sensitive data should be restricted to the minimum number of identities required to accomplish their job function</li>
  <li>Unused Privileges Revocation: Identities access privileges should be proactively reviewed on a regular basis in order to revoke unused or excessive permissions to maintain the PoLP and reduce the attack surface</li>
  <li>LP Access Reviews: </li>
  <li>Access privileges should be regularly reviewed and assessed to ensure they align with the current job/function requirements, to identify any unnecessary or excessive access and make adjustments accordinglyii. Automated tools should be implemented to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of PoLP practices and to identify any potential gaps or misconfigurations</li>

<p>To effectively review and validate user access for least privilege and separation of duties, CSPs should implement a comprehensive approach that encompasses implementation best practices, and a risk-based frequency for such reviews:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Access Management and Reviews: </li>
  <li>Access management processes and records should be centralized to facilitate easier identity access review and reduce the risk of inconsistencies across different cloud systemsii. Access reviews should be conducted for remediating obsolete, excessive or unnecessary access, to ensure that access rights adhere to roles and responsibilities, least privilege and SoD principlesiii. Access reviews should be automated, if possible, using automated tools and scriptsiv. Reviews of high-risk access configurations, such as administrator accounts and access to sensitive data should be prioritized for scheduling</li>
  <li>Access reviews should result to a re-approval of the PoLP, SoD or other entitlements that each identity continues to need to fulfill their job responsibilities or denial of any conflicting combinations of entitlements based on the current and future job responsibilities of the user's role</li>
  <li>Access Reviews Frequency: The frequency of identity access reviews should be commensurate with the organization's risk tolerance and the sensitivity of the data and systems being protected. For high-risk environments, reviews may be conducted on a daily or weekly basis, while less sensitive systems may be reviewed monthly or quarterly</li>
  <li>Access Review Documentation: The results of access reviews should be documented and records maintained for audit purposes</li>
  <li>Audit and Logging: Audit and logging capabilities should be implemented to track identity access activities and generate records of who accessed, what resources, and when, facilitating investigations and identifying any suspicious activity</li>
  <li>Continuous Monitoring and Evaluation: Continuous monitoring solutions should be implemented to scan for unauthorized or anomalous activities and to detect changes in access patterns, privilege escalation, and other potential security breaches</li>
  <li>Access Certification: An access certification process should be implemented that requires users to periodically justify their access privileges to ensure that access is still necessary and relevant for their current roles</li>

<p>Implementation best practices for the segregation of privileged access roles include (but are not limited to):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Privileged Access Roles Segregation:</li>
  <li>The roles and responsibilities of each privileged identity should be defined ensuring that no single identity holds excessive privileges in order to establish a separation of duties and reduce the risk of misuseii.

The roles and permissions that grant access to non-production environments should be separated from the roles and permissions that grant access to production environments</li>
  <li>Access Segregation to Different Privileged Areas:</li>
  <li>Privileged and administrative functions access should be divided into distinct realms, such as administrative access, encryption/key management, configuration changes, and logging, to prevent a single identity from compromising access to all these areas simultaneouslyii. Privileged activities should be isolated within a separate environment or virtual machine, where possible</li>
  <li>Access Restriction to Sensitive Data and Systems:</li>
  <li>Access controls should be implemented to restrict privileged users from accessing sensitive systems and data that are not directly related to their job duties (enforce PoLP for privileged accounts)ii. SSH keys with strong key encryption and rotation should be utilized to authenticate privileged access over SSH connections</li>
  <li>Privileged Access Segregation Reviews:</li>
  <li>Access roles with privileged and administrative capabilities should be reviewed and updated periodically to ensure proper segregation and within reasonable frequencies specified by the CSP&#x2019;s IAM policyii. Automated processes should be implemented to regularly review identities&#x2019; segregated privilege access permissions</li>

  <li>PAM solutions should be leveraged to manage and monitor privileged account access and credentials over privileged accounts, enabling secure storage and rotation of privileged credentials, auditing and logging access activity, and enforcing MFA for privileged sessionsvi. To ensure the security of critical accounts and sensitive data, all modifications to privileged access should trigger real-time notifications to security managers for review</li>
  <li>Privileged Access Request: </li>
  <li>A formal privileged access request process should be established that requires users to justify and obtain approval for accessing privileged accountsii. Privileged access should be granted only after the validation of justification and multiple levels of approvals</li>
  <li>Privileged Access Restriction: Privileged access to specific resources and systems, preventing users from traversing beyond their authorized scope should be restricted</li>
  <li>Automated Privilege Revocation: Automated processes for revoking privileged access upon termination of employment, role changes, or other relevant events should be implemented</li>
  <li>Privileged Access Sessions Duration:</li>
  <li>Session management capabilities should be implemented to limit the duration of privileged access sessions and enforce timed out sessions after inactivity periodsii. Just-in-Time Access (JIT) should be utilized to grant access only for the specific time period that is needed rather than granting permanent access to minimize the window of opportunity for unauthorized access</li>
  <li>Privileged Access Password Management: Strong password management practices for privileged accounts should be implemented including regular password changes and complexity requirements</li>
  <li>Access Exception Process:</li>
  <li>A process for granting temporary or exceptional access should be established for privileged accounts and only in exceptional circumstances (refer to CCC-08)ii. Authorization from senior management should be acquired and justifications for the access request documented</li>
  <li>Credential Vaulting and Rotation: A secure credential vault should be used to store and manage privileged access credentials. Credentials should be rotated regularly to minimize the risk of unauthorized access</li>
  <li>Privileged Access Escalation Prevention: Mechanisms to prevent privilege escalation, ensuring that users cannot elevate their access beyond their assigned privileges should be implemented (e.g., use RBAC, MAC access control mechanisms)</li>
  <li>Privileged Access Roles Reviews: Roles with privileged access and rights should be included in the periodic access review activities performed at reasonable frequencies specified by the identity and access management policy</li>
  <li>Continuous Monitoring and Logging: The effectiveness of privileged access roles should be monitored, logged and regularly assessed. PAM solutions, operating systems, and relevant software should be updated to address potential vulnerabilities </li>

<p>Implementation Guidelines.Applicable to all service models:</p>
<p>Processes, procedures and technical measures for authenticating access to systems, applications and sensitive data should be defined and maintained.</p>
<p>The CSP is responsible for ensuring that non-console administrative access and remote access require MFA.</p>
<p>MFA and digital certificate implementation best practices for sensitive data access include (but are not limited to):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Authentication Management: </li>
  <li>A centralized authentication system that can manage identities, authentication credentials, and access control permissions across all cloud services should be implementedii. Users that require privileged access (e.g., administrators and IT staff) should be identified to establish stricter authentication measuresiii. Specific authentication factors and technical measures should be defined and implemented for each access level, including MFA for privileged identities and sensitive data access</li>
  <li>MFA Usage Scope:</li>
  <li>Sensitive Data Access:  Strong authentication should be enforced at all user accounts, requiring a combination of something the user: Knows (such as a password); Has (such as a mobile device or token); Is (such as biometrics); MFA for all users should be enabled, including non-privileged users who access sensitive dataii. Administrative Access: MFA should be enforced for all administrative access (e.g., access to cloud management consoles, virtual machines, remote access gateways, and other critical cloud infrastructure elements). If MFA cannot be implemented in a particular situation, the risk should be formally registerediii. Remote Access: MFA should be enforced for all remote access, whether through VPNs, web applications, or mobile devicesiv. Third-Party Access: MFA should be enforced for third-party access, such as through APIs or cloud services, to protect against unauthorized access by external entities</li>
  <li>Second Factor Authentication: Second factor authentication should be leveraged in addition to passwords to add an extra layer of security by requiring a second factor of:</li>
  <li>Time-Based One-Time Passwords (TOTPs) to allow users to generate temporary codes via SMS, email, a smartphone app synchronized with an authentication serverii. Hardware tokens or USB keys that generate unique codes for authentication</li>
  <li>Passwordless Authentication: Passwordless authentication solutions should be implemented that replace traditional passwords with secure alternatives such as phishing-resistant MFA and FIDO2-compliant security keys or biometrics</li>
  <li>Authentication Credentials Protection: All authentication credentials should be transmitted through secure channels (e.g., TLS/HTTPS) and never stored in plaintext but rendered unreadable in storage on all system components using strong cryptography</li>
  <li>Authentication Credentials Change Approval: Requests to change or modify authentication credentials (i.e., performing password resets, provisioning new tokens, generating new keys) should be approved only after verification of the user&#x2019;s identity</li>
  <li>Continuous User Authentication (CUA): CUA should be leveraged as a method of maintaining user authentication throughout their session, requiring periodic reauthentication to ensure that the user is still authorized and has not been compromised</li>
  <li>Single Sign-On (SSO): SSO should be implemented for accessing multiple services and applications with a single login credential to simplify the authentication process for users</li>
  <li>Digital Certificates: Digital certificates should be utilized for authentication and authorization purposes, especially for system identities</li>
  <li>CRL and OCSP Checks: Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) and Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) checks should be implemented to verify the validity and revocation status of digital certificates</li>
  <li>Certificate Lifecycle: The lifecycle of digital certificates should be securely managed including issuance, renewal, and revocation</li>
  <li>Certificate Storage: Digital certificates should be stored securely, using encryption and access control mechanisms</li>
  <li>Authentication Usage Monitoring:</li>
  <li>All authentication mechanisms and enabled features should be properly installed, configured, and authentication logs monitored for the desired and expected resultsii. MFA, credentials, and digital certificate usage patterns should be should be continuously monitored and reviewed to proactively identify potential vulnerabilities or compromises</li>

<p>Implementation Guidelines.Applicable to all service models:</p>
<p>Systems interoperability is the primary concern of the CSC. The degree to which a CSP offers a service based on technology that is published or standardized  typically will increase the interoperability across cloud systems. Interoperability and portability controls aim to prepare the CSC to protect their business from failure in case of a CSP outage. This can include plans for interoperability and portability with other CSPs or a different region with the current provider.</p>
<p>IaaS Provider: The CSP should provide standardized hardware and computing resources that can interact with various disparate systems, with minimal effort, and which should strictly adhere to industry standards to maintain interoperability. The CSP should be able to support complex scenarios such as cloud brokerage, cloud bursting, hybrid clouds, multi-cloud federation, etc.</p>
<p>The CSP is responsible for implementing policies, processes, procedures and standards that enable the CSC in deploying architecture that can involve multiple CSPs, hybrid models, or moving to another CSP or private cloud. The policies, processes and procedures should remain current, be reviewed annually, be audited annually, and independent audit reports should be made available to the CSC. </p>
<p>PaaS Provider: The CSP is responsible for providing a platform on which the CSC can build its systems. The CSP provides a runtime environment and an integrated application stack. It allows developers to quickly develop and deploy custom applications on the offered platforms without the need to build the infrastructure. The CSP provides the entire infrastructure and its maintenance to its consumers.</p>
<p>The CSP is responsible for implementing policies, processes, procedures, and standards that support the CSC in developing and deploying applications that can be transferred to another CSP or private cloud. The policies, processes, and procedures should remain current, be reviewed annually, be audited annually, and independent audit reports should be made available to the CSC.</p>
<p>SaaS Provider: The CSP provides application capabilities over the cloud, and the CSC manages its administration and the information flowing in and out of the system. The end customer needs a browser and the majority of the administration at all the levels rests with the provider.</p>
<p>The CSP is responsible for implementing policies, processes, procedures, and standards that support the CSC in retaining data and metadata in line with their data retention standards, and recovering all data and metadata when the service ceases or when moving to another CSP or private cloud. The policies, processes, and procedures should remain current, be reviewed annually, be audited annually, and independent audit reports should be made available to CSCs. </p>
<p>Policies should include (but not limited to) provisions on the following: </p>

<ol>
  <li>Standardized Communication Protocols: Ensure seamless interaction between different application interfaces by mandating the use of widely accepted communication protocols (e.g., RESTful APIs, JSON, XML).</li>
  <li>Adopt industry-standard API protocols, such as RESTful APIs or SOAP APIs.ii. Document API specifications clearly and provide SDKs (software development kits) for developers.iii. Implement API gateways to manage and secure API traffic providing API documentation, including usage guidelines, example requests, and responsesiv. Implement versioning to manage changes and maintain backward compatibility.</li>
  <li>Secure Communication: Ensure that data exchanged between application interfaces is secure and protected from unauthorized access by implementing transport layer security (TLS/SSL) and enforcing authentication and authorization mechanisms.</li>
  <li>Standardized Data Formats: Ensure consistent data processing across diverse systems by defining and adhering to standardized data formats to facilitate interoperability between applications and data processing systems.</li>
  <li>Utilize standardized data formats, such as XML, JSON, or CSV, for data representation.ii. Implement data transformation and normalization techniques to ensure data consistency.iii. Adopt common data models and data exchange protocols to facilitate interoperable data processing</li>
  <li>Cross-Platform Compatibility: Support information processing across different platforms and environments by designing applications and processing workflows to be platform-agnostic. Use containerization technologies (e.g., Docker) to encapsulate applications.</li>
  <li>Utilize cloud-neutral development frameworks and tools, such as serverless computing platforms or containerization technologies.ii. Employ cloud-agnostic programming languages and libraries.iii. Adopt standardized deployment processes and configuration management tools for cloud platforms.</li>
  <li>Common Data Processing Standards: Ensure that information processing adheres to industry-accepted standards by implementing processing logic based on well-established standards (e.g., SQL for databases, Apache Spark for big data processing).</li>
  <li>Cross-Platform Development Tools: Enable developers to create applications that can run on different platforms without significant modification by providing development tools and frameworks that support cross-platform development.</li>
  <li>Containerization Support: Simplify the deployment and execution of applications across various environments by supporting containerization technologies (e.g., Kubernetes) to encapsulate applications, making them portable and independent of underlying infrastructure.</li>
  <li>Infrastructure As Code (IaC) Practices: Standardize the description and provisioning of infrastructure to ensure consistency across environments by encouraging the use of IaC tools (e.g., Terraform, Ansible) to define and manage infrastructure configurations in a portable manner.</li>
  <li>Standardized Data Exchange Formats: Facilitate consistent and unambiguous data exchange between systems by defining and adhering to standardized data exchange formats and structures, ensuring compatibility and reducing data transformation complexities.</li>
  <li>Data Integrity and Persistence: Ensure the reliability and integrity of data across different systems and storage environments by implementing data integrity checks, using reliable storage systems, and establishing backup and recovery mechanisms to maintain data persistence.</li>
  <li>Utilize data integrity validation mechanisms to ensure data accuracy during transfers.ii. Employ data masking techniques to protect sensitive data in logs and screenshots.</li>
  <li>Common Data Usage Policies: Standardize how data is accessed, utilized, and shared across different applications by defining and enforcing data usage policies, access controls, and permissions to maintain consistency and security.</li>
  <li>Data Portability Contractual Obligations:</li>
  <li>Define and document standardized formats for data exchange to facilitate portabilityii. The data retention period should specify the length of time data will be stored, taking into account legal and regulatory requirements. Implement automated processes for data retention and deletion.iii. The scope of data retained should be defined and made available to the CSCsiv. A comprehensive data deletion policy for retained data should be defined to include secure deletion methods (refer to DCS-01 and DSP-02)</li>
  <li>Contract Termination: Upon contract termination, CSPs should provide reasonable assistance to CSCs in exporting and transferring their data to another cloud environment or on-premises systems. This assistance may include providing technical documentation, data export tools, and necessary support to facilitate seamless data migration.</li>
  <li>Outline CSCs' access to data upon contract termination in the contractual agreementii. Implement secure methods for data handover or transfer to CSCsiii. Develop and document an exit plan that ensures a smooth transition of services and data to CSCsiv. Include security measures to protect data during the transition period</li>
  <li>Clearly define data ownership and transfer of ownership upon contract terminationvi. Include legal and technical mechanisms to ensure data confidentiality and integrity</li>
  <li>Approval: Approval requirements and senior management involvement to ensure alignment with the organization's strategic goals and risk appetite</li>
  <li>An approval process should be established for any changes or modifications to the policy and proceduresii. A documented record of approvals (including dates, names of approvers, and any relevant comments or discussions) should be maintained</li>
  <li>Communication: Effective communication of the policy and procedures should be facilitated to all relevant cloud stakeholders</li>
  <li>Maintenance and Reviews: Interoperability and portability policies and procedures should be documented, reviewed and updated at least annually to ensure alignment with evolving cloud security landscape and to reflect changes in cloud technology, regulations, and risks</li>

        <part id="IPY-01_imp_gui_csc" name="item"><title>CSC implementation guidelines</title><prop name="label" value="CSC"/><p>Control Ownership Rationale.The CSC is responsible for implementing policies, procedures, processes, and standards that support interoperability and portability with data formats, development languages, design patterns, and architectural requirements for cloud deployments. To avoid vendor lock-in, interoperability and portability should factor into the vendor selection process, continuous vendor audits, and exit planning. </p>
<p>Implementation Guidelines.Portability and interoperability combine to provide compatibility of cloud solutions. They are important considerations for cloud planning because together they ensure that cloud solutions continue to operate (through interoperability) and do so unchanged (through portability). When portability and interoperability between components is not addressed, unanticipated processing failures will likely result with associated costly disruption of business.</p>
<p>Interoperability impacts often arise within cloud computing when changing business needs drive the need for changing a service provider. While a system may be functioning to specifications with one CSP, it may not with a new provider. Lack of insight can lead to being locked to one cloud service provider. Inevitable business decisions will result in changes over time that may lead to a change in provider (e.g., due to a need to migrate providers or platforms, desiring a different feature set, complete loss of the provider, or a legal dispute).</p>
<p>The CSC should review the CSP's independent audit reports and documentation during the procurement process as well as throughout the period of contractual engagement. The CSC should ensure ongoing data risk assessments are carried out in support of interoperability and portability, and that internal policies and procedures are reviewed and updated to reflect any changes. </p>
<p>IaaS Customer:</p>
<p>Various factors that the CSC should consider when developing policies and procedures with respect to portability and interoperability are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>understand how virtual machine images can be captured and ported to new CSPs that may use different virtualization technologies, e.g., Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF) or Open Virtualization format (OVF)</li>
  <li>identify and eliminate (or at least document) any provider-specific extensions to the virtual machine environment</li>
  <li>understand what practices are in place to make sure appropriate de-provisioning of VM images occurs after an application is ported from the CSP</li>
  <li>understand hardware- and platform-based dependencies that need to be identified before migration of the application/data</li>
  <li>identify options to resume or extend service with the legacy CSP in part or in whole if new service proves to be inferior</li>
  <li>determine if there are any management-level functions, interfaces, or APIs being used that are incompatible with or unimplemented by the new provider. </li>
</ol>
<p>PaaS Customer:</p>
<p>Various factors that the CSC should consider when developing policies and procedures with respect to portability and interoperability are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>when possible, use platform components with a standard syntax, open APIs, and open standards, e.g., Open Cloud Computing Interface (OCCI)</li>
  <li>understand what tools are available for secure data transfer, backup, and restore</li>
  <li>understand and document application components and modules specific to the PaaS provider, and develop application architecture with layers of abstraction to minimize direct access to proprietary modules</li>
  <li>when migrating to a new platform, understand the impacts on performance and availability of the application, and how these impacts will be measured</li>
  <li>understand how application testing will be completed prior to and after migration, to verify that the services or applications are operating correctly. Ensure that both provider and user responsibilities for testing are well known and documented</li>
</ol>
<p>SaaS Customer:</p>
<p>Various factors that the CSC should consider when developing policies and procedures with respect to portability and interoperability are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>assure the possibility of migration of backups and other copies of logs, access records, and any other pertinent information which may be required for legal and compliance reasons</li>
  <li>perform regular data extractions and backups to a format that is usable without the SaaS provider. Understand whether metadata can be preserved and migrated. If possible use data escrow services.</li>
  <li>store unstructured data in an established portable format such as the interoperable ZIP format for both reduced storage and transfer requirements. Aggregate files into ZIP archives to reduce complexities of moving sets of multiple files</li>
  <li>ensure the storage format selected interoperates regardless of the underlying platform. Data may need to be accessible from mobile, to desktop, to mainframe</li>
  <li>understand whether any custom tools being implemented will have to be redeveloped, or the new vendor can provide those tools</li>
  <li>understand management, monitoring, and reporting interfaces and their integration between environments</li>
  <li>assure there exists a provision for the new vendor to test and evaluate the applications before migration</li>
</ol>
<p>Policies should include (but not limited to) provisions on the following: </p>

<ol>
  <li>ensure that the CSPs expose common and/or open interfaces to access all cloud functions in their cloud service offering</li>
  <li>ensure the ability to federate with different CSPs to enable higher levels of scalability</li>
  <li>plan to estimate costs involved for moving data to and from a CSP </li>
  <li>understand differences in security policy or controls, key management, and data protection between CSPs to avoid open undiscovered security gaps when moving to a new provider or platform</li>
  <li>assure security and privacy controls implementation effectiveness across old and new providers</li>
  <li>understand differences from a legal, regulatory, compliance, and operational perspective between CSPs. If the customer data and applications have strict compliance and privacy requirements, a new cloud vendor should be evaluated for those requirements before a decision to migrate is made</li>
  <li>understand how base services like monitoring, logging, and auditing would transfer over to a new vendor</li>
  <li>data integrity measures should be incorporated to ensure data remains unaltered while in the cloud (e.g., use watermarks, digital signing)</li>
  <li>use interoperable data compression for data moved to and from the cloud to reduce the volume of data being moved, and to reduce the time required to move</li>
  <li>use interoperable encryption such as that available through published specifications (e.g., OpenPGP, ZIP) that directly and persistently protect data and files regardless of the platform, storage systems, or location where it resides</li>
  <li>encrypt data before placing it in the cloud to avoid risks from multi-tenancy, or careless or disgruntled staff at the CSP</li>
  <li>understand who maintains access to data encryption keys, and retain control of all encryption keys as required by the encryption and key management policy</li>

The security architecture protecting the IaaS environment should be well documented, and follow a governed change management process. The configuration and associated documentation should be regularly reviewed at least annually, in order to identify any areas for improvement, or to adapt security policies to address new attack vectors. The CSP should also provide tools (either as part of the service or via a marketplace) to the CSC to enable them to build and design their own communications security architecture, however it is the responsibility of the CSC to deploy and manage the appropriate security controls.</p>
<p>PaaS Provider:</p>
<p>The CSP is responsible for monitoring, encrypting, and restricting communications across the infrastructure and the platform that is being delivered as a service to the CSC. This includes the use of secure protocols (TLS/HTTPS) and secure APIs to support the CSC in accessing the platform service, along with perimeter security controls and a monitoring function to identify any potentially malicious activity from outside of the PaaS environment. The security model should be well documented and regularly reviewed by the CSP, and the APIs with which the CSC interacts should be documented and shared externally to enable the CSC to understand how to interact with the service securely. The CSP is not responsible for the security of the applications or functions that are provisioned by the CSC, however the CSP may provide tools to support the CSC.</p>
<p>SaaS Provider:</p>
<p>The CSP is responsible for monitoring, encrypting, and restricting communications through all layers of the infrastructure, up to and including the application being offered to the CSC. The CSP should deliver an environment to the CSC that protects data in motion, provides an authentication and authorization mechanism to prevent unauthorized access to the environment, and implements security controls to prevent lateral movement across CSC environments. The configuration of the security model should be well documented internally with mature change management processes in place. Additionally, the CSP is advised to share an overview of the security controls with the CSC to enable it to make informed decisions around the security of the software being delivered as a service.</p>
<p>Implementation best practices for cloud network security include (but are not limited to):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Network Design Principles:</li>
  <li>Principles guiding the network design, such as security, resource scalability, performance, and regulatory compliance should be well comprehended and articulatedii. An inventory of authorized services, protocols, and ports permitted for communication between the cloud network environments should be established and maintainediii. Network security baselines should be implemented as part of a change management framework (refer to CCC-06) that encompass parameters for network virtualization and network security configurations, as well as define normal network traffic patterns for the detection of deviations and potential threatsiv. Guidelines for network segmentation, access control, and traffic management should be defined </li>
  <li>Network Communications Monitoring:</li>
  <li>Identification and analysis of network traffic should be implemented, focusing on the paths of information data flows, including its origins, destinations, and routes through sensitive network areasii. Network traffic monitoring and analysis tools should be implemented with capabilities for:</li>
  <li>Packet capture and analysis</li>
  <li>Flow monitoring</li>
  <li>Anomaly detection and behavioral analytics</li>
  <li>User activity trackingiii. Monitoring tools should be integrated with SIEM systems for centralized logging and analysis of network traffic</li>
  <li>Network Communications Encryption: End-to-end encryption should be implemented to secure data in transit across the network communication channels</li>
  <li>Network devices should be configured to enforce strong encryption for specific protocols and portsii. VPN tunnels should be utilized for secure communication between isolated network segments</li>
  <li>Network Communications Restriction:</li>
  <li>Access controls should be defined and enforced using firewalls, access control lists (ACLs), VPNs, and IAM systemsii. Firewalls should be deployed at key points within your cloud network architecture to act as gateways between internal and external network connections, filtering incoming and outgoing traffic based on pre-defined security rulesiii. Firewalls should be configured with granular access control rules, including IP address ranges, protocols, and portsiv. If the cloud environment requires publicly accessible services like web or email servers, a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) should be established, acting as a buffer zone for isolating sensitive internal resources from potential external threats</li>
  <li>Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA): Adopt a zero-trust approach to cloud network access control, assuming that no user or network device is inherently trusted until verified to dynamically enforce access restrictions based on user identity, device posture, and context</li>
  <li>Network Configurations Review: </li>
  <li>The inventory of allowed network services, protocols, ports, and compensating controls, and network security and access control configurations and encryption practices should be reviewed and updated at least annuallyii. The rationale for allowances should be well-justified based on business needs and risk assessments</li>
</ol>
<p>Container-Specific Implementation Guidelines.Network communications justified by the business should be allowed, encrypted, and require authorization. Conversely, unjustified network communications should be disallowed.</p>
<p>Container application-aware network monitoring tools should be leveraged for:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Container Network Surface: Automated determination of proper container networking surfaces, including both inbound ports and process-port bindings</li>
  <li>Container Traffic Flows: Detection of traffic flows between containers and other network entities over both wire traffic and encapsulated traffic</li>
  <li>Network Anomalies Detection: Detection of network anomalies, such as unexpected traffic flows within the organization&#x2019;s network, port scanning, or outbound access to potentially dangerous destinations</li>
  <li>Malicious Content Detection: detection of invalid or unexpected malicious processes and data introduced into the container environment</li>

<p>Implementation Guidelines.IaaS Customer:</p>
<p>The CSC is responsible for monitoring, encrypting, and restricting communications between the components that are deployed on top of the infrastructure service. This should include designing a communications security architecture that includes the appropriate use of secure protocols to protect data in motion. The CSC should implement a security monitoring capability, either cloud-native or through integration into an existing SOC platform, to integrate logs from the IaaS workload environment and identify suspicious events. The CSC should ensure that there are appropriate network-level controls in place to prevent unwanted access or exposure to resources, and to protect workloads from both lateral movement inside the environment, and malicious attackers from outside the environment. The configuration and associated documentation around communications security should be regularly reviewed, at least annually, in order to identify areas for improvement, or to adapt security policies to address new attack vectors. Change management in the environment should be defined by a well-managed process.</p>
<p>PaaS Customer:</p>
<p>The CSC is responsible to monitor, encrypt, and restrict communications across the components on top of the platform service. This includes the adoption of secure protocols (TLS/SSL) and secure APIs to ensure encrypted or protected access to the environment. The security model relating to any applications developed on top of the platform should be well documented and regularly reviewed by the CSC, taking into consideration any changes to CSP-provided APIs or infrastructure that may impact the CSC security model.</p>
<p>SaaS Customer:</p>
<p>The CSC consumes the entire software stack as a service and as such is not responsible for any of the security controls relating to communications security or communications monitoring. The CSC should however review CSP-provided documentation in order to make an informed decision around the security of the software delivered as a service.</p>

With regards to IaaS, there is a Shared and independent implementation responsibility between CSP and CSC for the Host and Guest OS hardening, since the CSP is responsible for the Host's hardening (OS and/or Hypervisor), and the CSC is responsible for the Guest VM and OS hardening. For PaaS and SaaS the implementation responsibility shifts to the CSP only, since the hardening of OS, hypervisor and underlying infrastructure are not part of CSC&#x2019;s cloud stack and therefore the CSC has no control over their secure implementation. </p>
<p>Implementation Guidelines.IaaS Provider: The CSP is responsible for provisioning hardware to support customer virtual machines that includes: hardening and maintaining updates to hypervisors, Host operating system, firmware, and utilizing confidential computing including trustworthiness assessment rooted in hardware, as well as Trusted Execution Environments,Trusted Platform Modules (TPM) and other trusted and assured equipment, obtained through a verified and reputable supplier. The CSP is not responsible for the updates to operating systems installed above the host infrastructure.</p>
<p>PaaS Provider:</p>
<p>The CSP is responsible for all system hardening host and guest OS patching across the infrastructure plane and it should do this as per the client&#x2019;s requirements or as defined by good practice, but is not responsible for application level patching.</p>
<p>SaaS Provider: The CSP is responsible for all elements of system patches, including application level requirements.</p>
<p>Where the CSP is responsible for the updates to host (hypervisor)/guest and other system patching, it should deploy suitable testing methods before rolling out updates. Updates should be deployed in a suitable time frame depending on contractual agreements.</p>
<p>Implementation best practices for cloud platforms hardening include (but are not limited to):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Host/Guest OS, Hypervisor, VMs, Control Plane Hardening:</li>
  <li>A secure configuration baseline using industry vendors and benchmarks should be created and utilized to ensure consistency across all platformsii. A minimal installation should be utilized and implemented, using pre-configured secure templates according to the baseline and having only essential system services/processes enabled (i.e., unnecessary ports, protocols, and network services should be disabled or removed to reduce the attack surface)iii. Software (OSes, Hypervisor, VMs and applications) should be kept up-to-date with the latest security patchesiv. Strong authentication (e.g., complex passwords, MFA) should be configured for accessing the hypervisor/VM/OS management interfaces</li>
  <li>Security features such as firewalls, anti-malware, and system logging should be enabledvi. Configurations should be regularly reviewed and updated against the configuration baseline to ensure only necessary features are enabledvii. For sensitive CSC workloads:</li>
  <li>A dedicated, single-tenant or bare-metal hypervisor instances should be used to avoid the exploitation of possible hypervisor vulnerabilities</li>
  <li>Conventional virtual machines (VMs) should be replaced with confidential VMs for enhanced security</li>
  <li>Secure boot and virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) should be utilized for enhanced security</li>
  <li>Hypervisors/OSes/VMs that have been rigorously tested for security should be selected (i.e., evaluated against Common Criteria (CC) Protection Profiles (PP) and assigned an Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL))</li>
</ol>
<p>VM Lifecycle-Specific Implementation Guidelines.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Creation</li>
  <li>Secure VM templates should be used that are pre-configured with security settings, including hardened OS configurations, patching schedules, and access controlsii. VM images should be scanned for vulnerabilities before provisioning them to CSCsiii. Unnecessary applications, services, and drivers should be removed from VM images to reduce the attack surfaceiv. A detailed inventory of all VMs should be maintained to track their creation, deployment, and status</li>
  <li>Compliance checks should be implemented to ensure VMs meet security and regulatory requirements</li>
  <li>Deployment</li>
  <li>Provisioning controls should be implemented to prevent unauthorized deployment of VMsii. Network segmentation should be used to isolate VMs from each other and the rest of the network.iii. Access controls should be implemented to restrict identities access to VMs based on the cloud IAM access control policyiv. Monitoring and alerting systems should be implemented and configured to detect suspicious activity and potential security breaches</li>
  <li>Change management process should be implemented to control and track changes made to VMs (refer to CCC domain)</li>
  <li>Operation</li>
  <li>Security patches and updates should be regularly applied to VMs to address vulnerabilities and prevent known exploitsii. Vulnerability scans should be regularly conducted to identify and remediate security weaknessesiii. Configuration management tools should be used to enforce consistent and secure configurations for VMsiv. VMs should be continuously monitored for resource usage, security events, and potential anomalies</li>
  <li>Logging and auditing of VM activity should be enabled to track changes and events.</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
  <li>Backup and recovery strategies should be implemented to protect VM data from loss or corruptionii. Maintenance tasks on VMs should adhere to the change management processiii. Any changes made to VMs should be tested and validated before deploying them to productioniv. Documentation of VM configurations, maintenance procedures, and security policies should be maintained</li>
  <li>Decommissioning</li>
  <li>VM disks should be encrypted before decommissioning to protect sensitive data from unauthorized accessii. VM disks should be securely destroyed or erased to prevent data recoveryiii. Decommissioned VMs should be removed from the inventory and tracking systems and the decommissioning process documented to ensure proper authorizationiv. Audit trails should be maintained to record the decommissioning activity and data destruction procedures</li>
</ol>
<p>Container-Specific Implementation Guidelines.Technical controls should aid situations when only the ports, protocols, and services necessary to meet business needs are provided. Such controls should be based on common benchmarks.</p>
<p>The CSP should implement anti-malware, file integrity monitoring, and logging, and utilize hardware rooted trust in confidential computing (CC) and  virtual trusted platform modules (vTPMs).</p>
<p>Whenever possible, organizations should use minimalistic, container-specific host operating systems with all other services and functionality disabled, and with read-only file systems and other hardening practices employed to reduce attack surfaces.</p>
<p>The following best practices for securing containers are also recommended:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Dedicated Container Host: hosts that run containers should only run containers and not other apps&#x2014;such as web servers or databases&#x2014;outside of containers</li>
  <li>Container Host Patch Management: Hosts that run containers should be continuously scanned for vulnerabilities and updated promptly</li>
  <li>Hardened Container Host: The host OS should not run unnecessary system services</li>
  <li>Container Host Access: Access to the container host should be based on the need-to-know and least privilege principles</li>
  <li>Container Security Monitoring: file integrity monitoring and host intrusion detection should be leveraged for containers.</li>
  <li>CC Protection: Where applicable, hosts should be measured by confidential computing hardware and attested to verify trust. This enables verification that the platform on which the host depends including firmware, boot code from the CPU silicon up is measured and attested even before the OS runs.</li>

<p>Implementation Guidelines.IaaS Customer:</p>
<p>The CSC is responsible for hardening and maintaining updates to their deployed operating systems to reduce the attack surface. This can be accomplished through a patch management system. The CSC is not responsible for the updates and hardening of the host OS or the hypervisor. The CSC needs to provide hardened baselines to those guest operating systems by utilizing security tools such as antivirus, firewalls, monitoring, logging, confidential computing, etc. The hardening of OS for guests should align with a recognized industry standard.</p>
<p>PaaS Customer: The CSC is responsible for maintaining updates to their own applications and installed software. They also are responsible for additional security hardening controls such as monitoring, logging, and protection of the applications and the stored data those applications contain. The CSC is also responsible for maintaining and justifying authorization and access to people that need that access.</p>
<p>SaaS Customer: The CSC should confirm appropriate controls are implemented to conform to its requirements and utilize software according to risk criteria.

<p>Applicable to all service models:</p>
<p>Implementation best practices include (but not limited to):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Segmentation Definition: Possible definitions of segmentation should be defined and understood including a range from &#x201C;total separation&#x201D; to &#x201C;partial logical separation&#x201D; of business-critical assets and/or personal data and sensitive user data, and sessions</li>
  <li>Multi-tenant Infrastructure Isolation: Multi-Tenant environments should be physically and logically separated and isolated to prevent unauthorized access between different tenants using various segmentation techniques like network segmentation, virtual machines, containerization to create isolated compartments for each tenant</li>
  <li>Network Segmentation:</li>
  <li>Network segmentation should be enforced at various levels, including virtual private clouds (VPCs), subnets, and security groups to restrict network traffic within and between tenants, and prevent unauthorized cross-tenant accessii. Virtualized networks (VNet) should be utilized to create private, isolated networks for each tenant and to compartmentalize tenant data and applications, preventing unauthorized access from other tenant environments. Implement Network Security Groups (NSGs) to enforce granular access control within each VNet.</li>
  <li>Access Segregation:</li>
  <li>Robust IAM practices should be established to control access to cloud resources and enforce segregation. Use RBAC, MFA and PoLP to limit access based on user roles and responsibilities. ii. CSP and CSC user access to cloud resources should be separated. CSPs should be provided with access to infrastructure components and management tools, while restricting CSCs to their own tenants&#x2019; resourcesiii. Cross-CSC protections should be implemented at the application layer to ensure that the CSC cannot compromise the CSP&#x2019;s applications to gain unauthorized access to the information of other CSCs</li>

<p>Implementation Guidelines.Applicable to all service models:</p>
<p>When migrating servers, services, applications, or data to cloud environments, CSPs should implement secure and encrypted communication channels to safeguard sensitive information. This ensures that data remains protected throughout the migration process and during its subsequent operation in the cloud.</p>
<p>The CSPs should adhere to the following implementation best practices:</p>

<ol>
  <li>End-to-End Data Encryption:</li>
  <li>Data should be encrypted at all stages of its lifecycle, from storage to transmission and processingii. Data-at-rest encryption should be employed to protect data stored on disks or persistent storage devices within the cloudiii. Data-in-transit encryption should be utilized to protect data transmitted between cloud components and between clients and the cloud</li>
  <li>Secure Transport Protocols:</li>
  <li>Up-to-date and industry-approved encryption protocols should be leveraged, at the various OSI layers, for communication between cloud infrastructure components and between clients and the cloud (e.g., Use HTTPS/TLS or FTPS (transport layer), IPSec (network layer), and secure file transfer protocols SFTP, SCP over SSH (application layer))ii. These protocols should be configured with strong cryptographic cipher suites and authentication mechanisms (refer to CEK domain) and used in accordance with corporate security standards and industry best practices</li>
  <li>VPN Technology:</li>
  <li>VPNs should be implemented to establish a secure and encrypted tunnel between on-premises networks and cloud environmentsii. VPN protocols like IPSec or TLS should be employed with strong encryption and authentication mechanisms</li>
  <li>API Security: If APIs are used in the migration process, they should be secured with proper authentication, authorization, and data validation mechanisms</li>
  <li>Authentication Mechanisms: MFA should be utilized to verify the identity of users and systems participating in the data transfer</li>
  <li>Limit Data Exposure:</li>
  <li>The amount of sensitive data being transferred should be minimized and only what is necessary exposedii. For sensitive data, using data masking or obfuscation techniques during migration should be considered to further reduce the risk of data exposure</li>
  <li>Migration Monitoring and Logging:</li>
  <li>All data transfers should be continuously monitored and logged during the migration processii. The security practices of any third-party vendors involved in the migration process should be evaluated and monitored</li>

For the SaaS solution, it is CSP-owned.In an IaaS service, the CSC shares responsibility with the CSP to deploy, manage, secure, and configure the networking solutions. Most networking security controls in a PaaS solution are provided by the CSP. In a SaaS service, network security controls are managed and secured for the CSC as part of a software core offering because the network infrastructure is abstracted.</p>
<p>Implementation Guidelines.Network-based attacks (such as but not limited to Layer 3 DDoS, man-in-the- middle, SQL Injection, IP spoofing, malware, etc.) attempt to gain unauthorized access to network infrastructure in order to compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of assets and information.</p>
<p>Network security controls (defense-in-depth techniques) detect and prevent attacks using advanced threat intelligence and protocol analysis, anomaly detection, indicators of compromise blocking, and signature-based methods.</p>
<p>The CSP should also expose security controls to the CSC so it can properly configure and manage its network security.</p>
<p>Vulnerabilities that exist in a physical environment also apply in a virtual environment. Configuration flaws/vulnerabilities in the applications, firewalls, or networks are vulnerable to exploits. Defense-in-depth techniques should be leveraged for both physical, logical, and administrative controls.</p>
<p>IaaS Provider: The CSP should define, implement and evaluate processes, procedures, and defense-in-depth techniques (e.g., DDoS mitigation solution, network filtering, firewalls, IDS/IPS) for protection, detection, and timely response to network-based attacks against the host infrastructure (hypervisor and operating system) and storage devices.</p>
<p>PaaS Provider: The CSP should define, implement and evaluate processes, procedures, and defense-in-depth techniques (e.g., DDoS mitigation solution, network filtering, firewalls, IDS/IPS) for protection, detection, and timely response to network-based attacks against the host infrastructure (hypervisor and operating system), storage devices, virtual machines, containers, platform-managed software including web services, database services, and analytics.</p>

<p>Applicable to all service models:</p>
<p>Defense-in-depth techniques/insights that should be considered include (but not be limited to):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Network Assets Scope and Protection Prioritization:</li>
  <li>A detailed and regularly updated inventory of all cloud network technologies and types within the cloud environment should be developed, including both wired and wireless network assetsii. Based on data sensitivity and its classification ensure that the most critical network assets receive prioritized protection measures</li>
  <li>Firewalls Management:</li>
  <li>Firewalls should be deployed at each layer of the cloud network (virtual private cloud [VPC], subnet, and application level) to filter traffic based on security rules and prevent unauthorized accessii. Web Application Firewalls should be deployed to protect web applications from common web-based attacks and block malicious requests before they can reach the application server (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and denial-of-service [DoS] attacks)</li>
  <li>Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS): IDS/IPS solutions should be implemented to monitor network traffic for suspicious activity and identify potential intrusions or attacks (IDS passively detects anomalies, while IPS actively blocks malicious traffic)</li>
  <li>Network Traffic Analysis (NTA):</li>
  <li>NTA tools should be utilized to gain deeper insights into network traffic patterns and identify anomalies that may indicate malicious activities (e.g., deep packet analysis, protect DDoS attacks with traffic throttling, and blackholing)ii. Ingress/egress traffic patterns may include media access control (MAC) spoofing, ARP poisoning attacks, and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks</li>
  <li>Network Traffic Encryption: Sensitive data in transit should be encrypted to protect it from interception and unauthorized access using secure network protocols such as TLS/IPsec for data transmissions within the cloud and between cloud and on-premises environments</li>
  <li>Network Threat Intelligence: </li>
  <li>Threat intelligence feeds should be utilized to stay informed about emerging network threats, vulnerabilities, and attack methods in the cloud environmentii. Threat intelligence should be integrated into network security systems to proactively detect and prevent cloud network attacks</li>
  <li>Network Infrastructure Patching and Updates: </li>
  <li>A vulnerability management program should target be leveraged to identify, assess, and remediate vulnerabilities in the cloud network infrastructure and software/applications (refer to TVM domain)ii. Stay up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates for cloud network infrastructure components to mitigate vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers</li>
  <li>Network Secure Configuration Management:</li>
  <li>Secure configuration standards for cloud network resources should be enforced (e.g., virtual machines, network devices settings, and cloud-based application deployment configurations)ii. Security settings should be enabled with strong encryption for authentication and transmission, and vendor default settings replaced (e.g., encryption keys, passwords, and SNMP community strings)</li>
  <li>Vendors Diversity of Security Controls: A variety of network and system components from different vendors should be used and integrated to reduce the risk of single points of failure and vulnerabilities</li>
  <li>Continuous Monitoring and Evaluation:</li>
  <li>Auditing and logging capabilities (e.g., SIEM solution) should be implemented to track network activity, user actions, and security events from various network assets Monitor logs for anomalies, suspicious activity, and potential breachesii. Capabilities should be developed to detect unauthorized (rogue) network devices in the network and disconnect them quickly</li>

<p>In instances where the CSC does not require their own ability and has shifted obligations for these to the CSP for all deployment models, the CSP would become the owner of the control but would require the CSC guidance on who may be authorized to access logs.</p>
<p>Implementation Guidelines.Applicable to all service models:</p>
<p>CSPs should secure audit logs to maintain the integrity and accountability of cloud operations. Both CSPs and CSCs have a responsibility to implement appropriate measures to protect audit logs from unauthorized access and ensure that they are tamper-proof.Audit logs contain information about activities, actions and events that may be sensitive in nature. Appropriate restrictions should be implemented to protect them from unauthorized access. Audit logs can be used to track access to assist in the identification and detection of suspicious activity. They also contain data that supports investigative needs in relation to analysis and security incidents.</p>
<p>Implementation best practices that aim to restrict audit log access include (but not limited to):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Log Access using RBAC: An RBAC system that defines and assigns specific audit log access permissions to different roles within the organization should be implemented</li>
  <li>Log Access Restrictions:</li>
  <li>MFA access to audit logs should be implemented for all personnel with a &#x2018;need to know&#x2019; (including privileged accounts) and according to the least privilege principleii. SoD should be implemented to prevent single individuals from escalating privileges or accessing sensitive log information beyond their authorized rolesiii. The number of individuals who have direct access to raw audit logs should be restricted (access control lists or dedicated log viewing tools should be used to control access)iv. Access to audit logs of internal systems and systems provided to the CSC should be restricted</li>
  <li>The CSP should receive an approved confirmation of any CSC personnel who need access to logsvi. Where the CSC has requested its own logging of audit logs, the CSP should allow the relevant configurations and forwarding to be supported</li>
  <li>Unique Access Accountability: Audit log entries should be associated with identities (including usernames, associated roles, purpose of access and resources accessed, IP addresses, and timestamps) to allow for accurate tracking of individual user actions, accountability, and usage for investigations and forensic analysis in accordance to legal/regulatory requirements</li>
  <li>Session Timeouts: Time-bound access restrictions for audit log access should be implemented, enforcing session timeouts and requiring audit log access reauthentication </li>
  <li>Log Access Infrastructure: The infrastructure that hosts and manages access to audit logs should be protected from cyberattacks and unauthorized access. Network and systems security measures should be implemented (refer to IVS domain)</li>
  <li>Audit Log Transfers Limitation: </li>
  <li>The transfer of audit logs to external systems or locations should be minimized, when necessary, in compliance with strict data handling procedures as per SLAii. Security tools (e.g., DLP) should be utilized to monitor and prevent the unauthorized export or transmission of sensitive information from audit logs</li>
  <li>Logging Standardization: Standardized logging and access practices should be established across all cloud environments and services</li>
  <li>Log Access Monitoring and Reporting: Access to audit logs should be monitored to identify any anomalies or potential breaches</li>
  <li>Log Access Reviews: Regular reviews of implemented access controls should be conducted to ensure that only authorized personnel have access to audit logs and to revoke unnecessary permissions</li>

<p>Implementation Guidelines.Recommendations that aim to restrict audit log access include (but not limited to):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Audit Logging and Access Enablement: </li>
  <li>Audit logging for cloud services should be configured and enabled based on security and compliance requirementsii. The CSP's audit log retention policies, access controls and encryption practices should be reviewed and understood for the CSC to ensure alignment own security and privacy requirementsiii. Collaborate with the CSP to agree on the scope of audit logs to be captured, maintained and accessed as per agreed SLAiv. Clear procedures should be communicated and established with the CSP for requesting and accessing audit logs</li>
  <li>Audit Log Transfers Limitation: </li>
  <li>The transfer of audit logs to external systems or locations should be minimized, when necessary, in compliance with strict data handling procedures as per SLAii. Security tools (e.g., DLP) should be utilized to monitor and prevent the unauthorized export or transmission of sensitive information from audit logs</li>
  <li>Audit Logs Access: MFA access to audit logs should be implemented for all personnel with a &#x2018;need to know&#x2019; (including privileged accounts) and according to the least privilege principle</li>
  <li>Unique Access Accountability: Audit log entries should be associated with identities to allow for accurate tracking of individual user actions, accountability, and usage for investigations and forensic analysis in accordance to legal/regulatory requirements</li>
  <li>Log Access Monitoring and Reporting: Access to audit logs should be monitored to identify any anomalies or potential breaches</li>
  <li>Log Access Reviews: </li>
  <li>Access permissions for CSC personnel should be regularly reviewed, updated and managed based on their roles and responsibilitiesii. Access should be revoked for individuals who no longer require it. Any unauthorized access attempts should be investigatediii. Best practices and security updates from the CSP should be followed and leveraged to regularly review and enhance internal security measures to restrict audit logs access effectively</li>

The CSP also establishes a process to investigate the deviations by generating alerts and taking appropriate actions. The implementation responsibility for this control is owned by both CSP and CSC, and in a dependent manner, as the CSP should engage the CSC if the investigation or remediation action requires the involvement of the CSC&#x2019;s personnel.</p>
<p>Implementation Guidelines.Applicable to all service models:</p>
<p>Audit logs contain information about activities, actions, and events that are happening in the cloud environment. These logs can be monitored and analyzed to identify when, what, and who: when the event happened, and of  potentially malicious activities that may have occurred. Remediation actions should be considered within the SLA as necessary to minimize the blast radius and business impact.</p>
<p>A baseline of the normal, expected activity should be defined, and logs should be continuously monitored for any malicious behavior.  </p>
<p>Implementation best practices for logs monitoring include (but not limited to):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Log Monitoring:  </li>
  <li>Audit logs should be monitored for anomalies and suspicious patterns and for all relevant actions (success/failure) such as changes, deletion, copying, or other such modification of settingsii. Audit logs should be integrated with SIEM systems to correlate log data and provide a holistic view of security anomalies and potential security events</li>
  <li>Collection and Analysis:  </li>
  <li>Automated tools should be leveraged to collect and analyze audit logs in real-time or near real-timeii. The level of detail logged should be limited, especially for sensitive dataiii. Logging of personal data or other confidential data should be avoided and in accordance with laws and regulationsiv. A forensic process for analyzing audit logs should be established in case of security incidents or compliance audits</li>
  <li>Response Procedures: </li>
  <li>Initial response instructions or escalation procedures, including who to contact or what actions to take immediately after anomaly detection should be defined and implemented (e.g., SOP of remediation actions to engage the CSC&#x2019;s personnel)ii. Response procedures should be implemented (and automated where possible) to streamline the process of investigating detected anomalies, issuing alerts, containing threats, and remediating vulnerabilitiesiii. Reporting solutions should provide near real-time visibility of anomalies and potential security events to reduce time to respond and resolve</li>
  <li>Stakeholders Communication: </li>
  <li>Roles and responsibilities should be defined for receiving and escalating security alerts to relevant stakeholdersii. Multiple communication channels should be employed to ensure timely delivery of alertsiii. Centralized dashboards should be provided for stakeholders to monitor alert trends, visualize data, and drill down into specific events</li>
</ol>
<p>Logs Monitoring should be enabled for all relevant types of logs, including, but not limited, to the following cloud systems and applications:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Administrative activity logs: These logs pertain to privileged user logins and administrators at all levels of the cloud stack and can be used to identify unauthorized access to sensitive data (e.g., Identity and access management (IAM) systems, cloud storage systems, authentication servers, and Single Sign-On (SSO) solutions)</li>
  <li>Network Traffic Logs: These are logs for tools that can be used to identify unauthorized access attempts, malicious traffic, and data exfiltration (e.g., Firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS), load balancers, web application firewalls (WAFs), virtual private networks (VPNs) Anti-Virus (AV) software, Anti-DDoS, Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), data loss prevention (DLP) solutions, etc.)</li>
  <li>Operating System Logs: Should be used to identify unauthorized access attempts, privilege escalation, and malware infections that apply to systems such as operating systems, virtual machines, cloud instances, containers</li>
  <li>Applications Logs: pertaining to CSC-owned applications or use of third-party applications activity that can be used to identify errors, exceptions, and suspicious activity. These logs apply to systems such as application servers, web servers, databases, containerized applications, application servers, Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) environments, and serverless computing services</li>
  <li>Encryption and Key Management Logs: These are Logs from encryption and key management systems/services</li>
  <li>API Logs: These are logs and metrics from the APIs of the cloud service provider, for the cloud services they provide such as CPU, network, cloud Storage I/O, databases/message queues, cloud management console, platform service logs and metrics, indicating changes in infrastructure configurations</li>
</ol>
<p>For all logs types, actions (success/failure) such as access, changes, deletions, copying of data, or other modification of configurations and settings should be monitored and relevant logs collected and analyzed.</p>

  <li>Scope: The IR plan should apply to both internal dependencies (such as IT, operations, support, and legal) and external dependencies (suppliers, vendors, partners, customers, and other third parties). The cloud services, systems, applications, users, and data that are in scope and monitored for events and incidents. Ensure the scope network and infrastructure is monitored by the CSP</li>
  <li>Incident Response Team and Stakeholders: The stakeholders include customers, law enforcement who receive information about incidents and/or can be involved in incident management</li>
  <li>Incident Tracking and Classification: Define the issue and tracking system used for recording the incident. Classify incidents by severity and urgency (e.g., High, Medium, Low, Major vs Minor), using threat intelligence, attack vector taxonomy Mitre ATT&amp;CK for PaaS, IaaS, and SaaS tactics and techniques, and data classification for any data involved, the scope, and the impact of the incident.</li>
  <li>Response Type and Expected Response Timeframes: The plan should indicate when a manual vs. automated response is required by the CSP or CSC, the time frames to respond by (e.g., mean time to acknowledge aka MTTA), by when the CSP or CSC is required to report an incident, who is responsible for containment of the incident, and the average expected mean time to containment (MTTC). The response may invoke subsequent IR plans such as an encryption key compromise-recovery plan for restoring cryptographic security services</li>
  <li>Evidence Gathering and Handling: Steps to collect and maintain the integrity of the evidence should be provided, when and where to make copies, when to use exact replicas for analysis, the CSP&#x2019;s or CSC&#x2019;s responsibilities around logs, other collected evidence, storing in restricted read-only repositories, using a separate account or another CSP, hashing procedures, and chain of custody for ensuring admissibility in legal proceedings</li>
  <li>Incident Lifecycle Phases and Procedures: Procedures for preparation, detection and analysis, eradication and recovery, post-mortem with continuous analysis at each phase to determine effectiveness, the CSC&#x2019;s preventative measures such as IDS/IPS, and provide specificity around incidents with shared responsibilities.</li>
  <li>Roles and Responsibilities: Common shared security responsibilities between the CSP and CSC in relation to incident response:</li>
  <li>Client and endpoint incidents &#x2013; (SaaS) shared CSC and CSPii. Identity and access incidents &#x2013; (PaaS, SaaS) shared CSC and CSPiii. Application Incidents &#x2013; (PaaS) shared CSC and CSPiv. Network incidents &#x2013; (IaaS) shared CSC and CSP</li>
  <li>Host incidents &#x2013; (IaaS) shared CSC and CSPCommon non-shared responsibilities:vi. Data classification and accountability incident &#x2013; CSCvii. Client and endpoint incidents (IaaS, PaaS) &#x2013; CSCviii. Identity and access incidents (IaaS) &#x2013; CSCix. Application incidents (IaaS) &#x2013; CSC</li>
  <li>Application incidents (SaaS) &#x2013; CSPxi. Network incidents (PaaS, SaaS) &#x2013; CSPxii. Host incidents (PaaS, SaaS) - CSPxiii. Infrastructure incidents (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) - CSP</li>
  <li>Notification and Reporting: List of personnel at the CSP and CSC, third-party personnel, and distribution lists for notification. Use internal and external websites or portals where incidents and service outage information can be published and updated regularly to advise on the status of incidents that affect major services. US-CERT (required for US federal agencies and systems operated on behalf of the federal government) serves as the federal incident response center</li>
  <li>Business Impact Assessment Information: The CSP and CSC should have BIA information for each asset, system, application, and associated classified data, with owners identified and the relevant internal departments, upstream/downstream interdependencies, services (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), and other business-critical relationships (such as supply chain) that may be impacted</li>
  <li>Reference Information: Information on how to determine the applicable RPO, RTO, and MTD of a particular system or set of systems for restore from backup recovery procedures to restore affected services, logs, and data as per agreements between the CSC and CSP to maintain business continuity. Outline the criteria required to select the appropriate eradication and recovery choice, e.g., restore, rebuild, replace, redirect or remove.</li>
  <li>Schedule: A schedule to review, test, evaluate, and maintain and approve the plan. Define the frequency or schedule to conduct the review, test coordination, and approve the plan. </li>
  <li>Plan Testing: Conduct a paper walk through/table top exercise or simulation where feasible with the participation of both the CSP and CSC as defined in the schedule. Evaluate and maintain/update the plan accordingly:</li>
  <li>after testing the plan and with lessons learned obtainedii. after incidents that resulted in changes to the response methodology, e.g., new attack vectors, containment strategies, false positives, false negatives, or caused a deviation from the response plan, and exposures detected from penetration testing.iii. Timing: When services (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), critical assets, applications, and classified data are either added or removediv. Plan Reapproval: The plan should be reapproved after all necessary changes are made</li>
  <li>Change Control: The IR plan should maintain a document control section indicating when the plan was tested and the changes to the plan content with each iteration</li>

<p>The CSP should: </p>

<ol>
  <li>validate and update all contact information and IR team members</li>
  <li>validate and update the scope of the IR plan, both internal dependencies (such as IT, operations, support, and legal) and external (suppliers, vendors, partners, customers, and other third parties). The cloud services, systems, applications, users and data that are in scope and monitored for events and incidents. Ensure the scoped network and infrastructure is monitored by the CSP</li>
  <li>define the scope for the IR test (e.g., an environment for the IR plan testing should include the following options, but not be limited to: a duplicate test/simulation environment, an alternate non production environment, and a third party CSP cloud service/account)</li>
  <li>decide which area in the threat landscape to test the IR plan with e.g., the tactics techniques procedures (initial access, execution, persistence, privilege escalation, defense evasion, credential access, discovery, lateral movement). Follow an attack vector taxonomy process using the Mitre ATT&amp;CK  for IaaS, PaaS, SaaS tactics and techniques to simulate events and activities that would result in an incident</li>
  <li>schedule the IR plan test &#x2013; arrange meetings with participants, the CSP, and the CSC as defined in the plan</li>
  <li>conduct the paper walk through or simulation following the IR plan and all phases of the incident. Maintain a chronological log of the testing activities for metrics and indicators of successfully completing all timed activities and steps outlined in the plan</li>
  <li>coordinated test, review, and update manual processes and automated incident management features, detection, alerting, playbooks, logic apps, rules, containment, eradication and recovery strategies</li>
  <li>reconcile the organization's BC and DR plans with the IR plan, and address discrepancies</li>
  <li>document and communicate the IR plan test results, with resulting action items that address areas that failed during the test, deviated from the response methodology, containment strategies, false positives, false negatives, or could not be executed</li>
  <li>update the plan to address discrepancies and failures, and obtain reapproval of the plan</li>
</ol>
<p>The CSP and CSC should also test, update, and improve IR plans after:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Breach Notification Plan: </li>
  <li>What constitutes a security breach, and the types of incidents requiring notification (unauthorized access attempts, data exfiltration) should be defined ii. Breach information should be included in breach notifications and specify the nature of the breach, affected data types, potential risks, and mitigation steps takeniii. Procedures for notifying relevant parties should be defined including impacted CSCs, regulatory bodies, and internal stakeholders, as per SLAs and relevant regulationsiv. Timeframes for notifying impacted parties based on the severity of the breach and relevant regulations should be defined (e.g., 72 hours as mandated by some data breach laws)</li>
  <li>Supply Chain Breach Notification:</li>
  <li>Vendor contracts should include provisions requiring notification of security incidents impacting the CSPs' servicesii. Breach notification procedures should adhere to data protection regulations</li>
  <li>Breach Notification Channels: Appropriate communication channels for notifying affected parties about security breaches should be established</li>

<p>Implementation Guidelines.Applicable to all service models:</p>
<p>CCM control STA-02 is the primary control whereby the SSRM for a given cloud service implementation is documented, implemented, and managed.</p>
<p>SSRM Documentation.  CCM controls STA-03 and STA-04 provide input to this control in the form of SSRM guidance from the CSP to the CSC (STA-03), and the CSP and CSC working together to specifically delineate control ownership and responsibilities for all CCM controls (STA-04).  </p>
<p>For controls that are CSC-owned, the CSP should provide it with clear and concise guidance on expectations for the CSC's SSRM responsibilities.</p>
<p>For controls that are CSP-owned or &#x201C;Shared (Independent),&#x201D; the CSP is responsible for documenting those for which they are fully or partially responsible. This documentation is developed under control STA-03 to fully document the service offering and provide SSRM guidance to prospective CSCs. The CSP should specifically document the responsibilities of any third party it has engaged to fulfill a control responsibility. Such documentation should address, in particular, any necessary coordination between the third party, the CSC, and the CSP.</p>
<p>For those controls that are &#x201C;Shared (Dependent),&#x201D; the CSP should collaborate with the CSC to ensure that each party's responsibilities are fully documented and consistent with the delineation of responsibilities developed under STA-04.</p>
<p>SSRM documentation should also address or reference service level expectations, workload management, contact, escalation, supporting tools, reporting, or other information that may be necessary or helpful in managing the CSC's and CSP's respective responsibilities.</p>
<p>To ensure adequate coverage, all CCM controls should be addressed in the SSRM, even if specifically noted to be not applicable. Further, the delineation of responsibilities in the SSRM should be consistent with any contractual terms agreed to by the parties under STA-09, or may be incorporated directly or by reference in the contract. The CSC and CSP may defer documenting certain details of the SSRM until after the contract is executed or the service is implemented, however, the SSRM should always remain consistent with the contractual agreement.  </p>
<p>SSRM Implementation and Management.  Once agreed to by the CSP and CSC, the SSRM for a given cloud service implementation guides many aspects of the ongoing relationship.  </p>
<p>Each party is responsible for implementing, managing, monitoring, and auditing their respective responsibilities for each CCM control as delineated in the SSRM (see STA-06). If questions or issues arise regarding control responsibility, the SSRM and contract agreement should be consulted to address and resolve any ambiguities. The CSP and CSC should review their supply chain agreement, and the associated SSRM for the services, at least annually (see STA-10). The SSRM should be updated as necessary to address any changes or clarifications in the shared security responsibilities. If an SSRM requires an update, the CSP should determine if the update is specific to a given CSC implementation, or if the SSRM for the service offering at large should be updated (see STA-03).</p>
<p>The CSP may choose to implement automated tools or reporting to facilitate the ongoing monitoring and management of the SSRM or the underlying service's controls.</p>
<p>The need for the CSP and CSC to document, implement, and maintain the SSRM for a cloud service implementation remains the same for all cloud service models. However, the specifics of each SSRM could change from implementation to implementation.</p>

<p>Implementation Guidelines.Applicable to all service models:</p>
<p>SSRM Guidance Documentation.  The CSP should develop SSRM guidance documentation for each cloud service offering. The documentation should demonstrate the CSP's transparency to the CSC, and clearly articulate expectations for the security responsibilities expected of the CSC.  </p>
<p>The SSRM guidance should detail the CSP's responsibilities with respect to each control for the service offering, as well as the responsibilities that need to be undertaken by any third party in the CSP's supply chain. The guidance should be as detailed and unambiguous as possible, particularly where a control has a shared responsibility between the CSP and its supply chain.  </p>
<p>The SSRM guidance should also detail the CSP's expectations to be undertaken by the CSC (or, possibly, by the CSC's supply chain). The guidance should detail the controls where the CSC is expected to be fully responsible, as well as the controls where there is a shared responsibility with the CSP.  For areas of shared responsibility, the CSP should provide any expectations for how that shared responsibility will be undertaken and managed.  </p>
<p>The below responsibility designations should be documented for each control in the SSRM, and for each cloud service model, as:</p>

<ol>
  <li>CSP-Owned: The CSP is fully responsible for implementing, managing, and assessing the control</li>
  <li>CSC-Owned: The CSC is fully responsible for implementing, managing, and assessing the control</li>
  <li>Shared (Independent): The CSP and CSC both need to implement the control, but their implementations are independent of one another</li>
  <li>Shared (Dependent): The CSP and CSC have joint responsibilities for the implementation, management, and assessment of the control</li>
</ol>
<p>For some service offerings there may be controls where the CSP undertakes responsibility on a conditional basis or for an additional fee. For example, the CSP may offer backup services as an additional service offering. Any such contingent services or areas where SSRM responsibilities may be determined at a later time should be clear in the SSRM guidance.</p>
<p>The CAIQ provides a thorough and convenient means for CSPs to document the SSRM ownership of the controls for its cloud service offerings. The SSRM product offering guidance may additionally reference other control or product documentation, service level objectives, test or assessment results, compliance mappings, etc.</p>
<p>Providing Guidance to the CSC.  The CSP should provide the SSRM guidance documentation to the prospective CSC. It serves as the basis for the detailed review of SSRM responsibilities between the CSP and the CSC under control STA-05. The documentation may be augmented by other product information, CSP organizational information, technical presentations, sales presentations, etc. over the sales cycle.</p>
<p>The SSRM guidance provided to the CSC is a key component in ensuring transparency and in avoiding later issues related to service responsibilities or contractual terms. The CSP should be prepared to educate and assist the prospective CSC in SSRM principles and implementation in order to effectively allocate, document, and implement their respective SSRM responsibilities. </p>

Each party's supply chain inventory and inventory management practices are independent of the other.</p>
<p>Implementation Guidelines.Applicable to all service models:</p>
<p>The CSP should establish and maintain an inventory of all supply chain relationships. This inventory can be used to support various supply chain management activities including:</p>

<ol>
  <li>recurring due diligence review scheduling and coordination</li>
  <li>management of contractual and legal matters (e.g., renewals, notices, disputes)</li>
  <li>ongoing management of the SSRM</li>
  <li>supply chain risk management program reporting to management</li>
  <li>management of licenses</li>
  <li>BIA for the business continuity management program</li>
  <li>communication, coordination, and escalation during cybersecurity or availability incidents</li>
  <li>analysis of supply chain aggregate and concentration risk</li>
</ol>
<p>The supply chain inventory should generally track the following key information, as needed, in support of the above activities:</p>

<ol>
  <li>internal and supplier contacts (e.g., business owner, relationship manager, legal, technical, support services, emergency)</li>
  <li>supplier risk ranking</li>
  <li>general contract terms (e.g., contract duration, renewal dates, termination dates, etc.)</li>
  <li>license counts or use restrictions</li>
  <li>key business process support or dependency information (e.g., in support of BIA)</li>
  <li>ongoing requirements and schedules for due diligence, periodic reviews, and monitoring</li>
</ol>
<p>The CSP may choose to &#x201C;risk rank&#x201D; or create a risk-based classification scheme for their suppliers. Risk ranking of suppliers facilitates determining the appropriate level of effort and comprehensiveness for supplier due diligence and ongoing management and monitoring activities.  Risk ranking of suppliers also supports analyses of aggregate supply chain risk.</p>
<p>The CSP may implement practices for identifying, or incorporating, supply chain relationships that are established outside of normal organizational procurement practices (so-called "shadow" purchases of products or services).  </p>
<p>Maintenance of the supply chain inventory should be embedded in procurement and supplier security management procedures, and responsibilities for inventory maintenance should be clearly established. The inventory should be updated at various key points over the life cycle of the supplier relationship, including contract termination.  The inventory should be reviewed and updated, if necessary, at least annually.</p>

<p>Implementation Guidelines.Applicable to all service models:</p>
<p>The CSP bears the primary responsibility for the effective implementation of policies and procedures aimed at malware protection within the cloud environment. This involves safeguarding CSC data and the cloud infrastructure from evolving malware threats by implementing a layered approach to security and deploying and maintaining robust malware prevention tools, such as antivirus and anti-malware software, across all cloud instances. The CSP must diligently enforce network security controls, including firewalls and intrusion detection/prevention systems, to monitor and filter incoming and outgoing traffic for potential malware threats, as well as, access controls, data encryption, and vulnerability management best practices.</p>

The CSP and the CSC are independently responsible for determining which such detection specifications are necessary for their respective requirements and to ensure these are adequately defined, implemented, and operated.For SaaS implementations, CSPs will typically be responsible for this control; however, there are specific use cases where the CSC and CSP have a shared responsibility in this area.</p>
<p>Implementation Guidelines.Applicable to all service models:</p>
<p>To maintain an effective threat detection posture, the CSP should ensure that the latest stable version of detection tools (e.g., network firewalls, WAF, NIDS, NIPS, HIDS, HIPS, network layer distributed DDoS protection, application layer DDoS protection, anti-malware software) are installed, and threats signatures and indicators of compromise (IoC) updated on a regular basis, preferably weekly or more frequently.

<p>Implementation best practices for updating detection tools, threat signatures, and indicators of compromise vulnerabilities include (but are not limited to):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Threat Intelligence Platform: A centralized threat intelligence platform should be implemented to aggregate and curate threat data from various sources, including internal security feeds, industry reports, external threat intelligence providers, and open-source intelligence (OSINT) to provide unified access to threat indicators, signatures, and vulnerabilities</li>
  <li>Threat Data Collection and Processing: The process of collecting and processing threat data from various sources should be automated (e.g., via scripts, APIs, or dedicated threat intelligence feeds) and threat data integrated into the threat intelligence platform for analysis and correlation</li>
  <li>Threat Prioritization Criteria: Criteria for prioritizing threat data should be established and based on factors such as the severity of the threat, the potential impact on cloud infrastructure and CSCs data</li>
  <li>Threat Signatures and Update Framework: A framework should be created for updating threat signatures for detection tools. This framework should include:</li>
  <li>Continuous monitoring of threat intelligence feeds and internal security logs for new threats and IoCsii. Analysis of newly identified threats to determine their relevance to the CSP's cloud environment and CSC baseiii. Updates of threat signatures and IoCs based on the analysis of new threatsiv. Testing and validation of new signatures and IoCs before deployment to ensure they accurately detect threats without causing false positives</li>
  <li>Detection Tools Updates: Updates for detection tools should be regularly scheduled and such tools should be configured to automatically receive updates from the vendor or threat intelligence platform (e.g., IDS/IPS tools, anti-malware software, firewalls) </li>
  <li>Version Control for Signatures and IoCs: A version control process for threat signatures and IoCs should be maintained to track changes and facilitate rollbacks if necessary. A version control system (e.g., Git) can be used to manage and store signatures and IoCs</li>
  <li>Continuous Monitoring and Evaluation: </li>
  <li>The effectiveness of detection tools and the impact of updates on system performance and resource utilization should be continuously monitored. Metrics should be used to measure the success of the threat detection process (e.g., number of threats detected, the rate of false positives, and the time taken to respond to threats)ii. Lessons learned from security incidents and threat analysis should be incorporated into the threat detection processiii. Security audits and penetration testing should be regularly conducted to assess the effectiveness of the threat detection process and identify potential gaps or weaknesses.

<p>In specific use cases, the SaaS CSC is typically responsible for determining the types of activities, events, or states for which detection tools, signatures, and indicators of compromise are desired and required and therefore need to be defined, implemented, and evaluated for a given SaaS implementation. The SaaS CSC is responsible for ensuring associated detection specifications are adequately defined, implemented, and operated. These may be accomplished in various ways, including through additional service subscription with the original CSP or through integration with the alternative services of a different third-party provider.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Vulnerability Scanning Tools and Schedule: </li>
  <li>Vulnerability scanning tools (automated, if possible) should be utilized to regularly scan the cloud infrastructure, applications, and data for known vulnerabilitiesii. Vulnerability scanning tools should be integrated into continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines to identify and address vulnerabilities early in the development processiii. A regular scanning schedule should be defined to ensure timely detection of newly discovered vulnerabilities and minimize exposure to potential attacks</li>
  <li>Log Analysis: Logs from the cloud infrastructure components should be analyzed to identify anomalies and potential open vulnerabilities (e.g., improperly defined access rules, gaps to systems configurations)</li>
  <li>Threat Intelligence Feeds: Threat intelligence feeds should be leveraged to stay informed about emerging vulnerabilities, threat trends, and exploited vulnerabilities in order to prioritize vulnerability scanning and remediation efforts, focusing on vulnerabilities that are actively being targeted by attackers</li>
  <li>Vulnerability Databases and CVEs: </li>

  <li>Vulnerability Assessments and Penetration Testing (VAPT): Engage in regular VAPT exercises to identify and exploit potential vulnerabilities that may not be detected by automated scanning tools (refer to TVM-06)</li>
  <li>Configuration Management: Configuration management tools should be leveraged (e.g., open-source Ansible) to enforce secure configurations and reduce the risk of misconfigurations</li>
  <li>Reporting and Escalation Procedures: Reporting and escalation procedures for identified vulnerabilities should be implemented</li>
  <li>These procedures should outline who is responsible for remediation, the timelines for addressing vulnerabilities, and the mechanism for escalation in case of critical or high-risk vulnerabilitiesii. The CSP should provide CSC with guidelines to protect against threats and vulnerabilities and external library vulnerabilities using appropriate tools, relevant automation, and operational frameworks within risk tolerance</li>
  <li>Continuous Monitoring and Evaluation: The effectiveness of vulnerability identification processes should be continuously monitored and evaluated, and adjustments made as needed</li>
</ol>
<p>The integrated TVM system should track vulnerabilities to closure and report them to build oversight of residual risks. Furthermore, the system should retain information that can be reused in future remediation activities.</p>
<p>The CSP should consider establishing an external-facing vulnerability disclosure program to allow external parties to communicate detected vulnerabilities.</p>

The CSP and CSC are responsible for tracking and reporting vulnerability identifications within the assets they own and securely manage.</p>
<p>Implementation Guidelines.Applicable to all service models:</p>
<p>For all identified vulnerabilities on the host infrastructure, network devices, virtualization technologies, operating systems, platform applications such as databases, and web applications, the CSP is responsible for defining and implementing a process for tracking and reporting vulnerability identification and remediation activities that includes stakeholder notification.</p>
<p>The integrated TVM system should have comprehensive vulnerability tracking capabilities. Capabilities should include tracking when discoveries were made and remediated, systems impacted, reasons for the delay (where applicable), and any communications with stakeholders.</p>
<p>Implementation guidelines of a tracking and reporting system for all service models include (but not be limited to):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Tracking System: A tracking system should be established to maintain a record of all vulnerabilities identified, prioritized, and remediated. This system should provide a view of vulnerability history, remediation status, and remaining open issues</li>
  <li>The format and structure of vulnerability data stored in the tracking system should be standardizedii. The aggregation of vulnerability data from various sources should be automated, where possible, including vulnerability scanners, remediation tools, and third-party feedsiii. CSP APIs should be leveraged to automatically collect vulnerability data from cloud services and resources to provide real-time visibility into cloud-specific vulnerabilitiesiv. A secure platform established for sharing threat intelligence and vulnerability information with CSCs. APIs and integration options for CSCs should be offered, to incorporate vulnerability remediation data into their own security tools</li>
  <li>Reporting and Notification: </li>
  <li>A process and procedure should be implemented to communicate remediation plans to stakeholders, providing clear timelines and expected outcomes for vulnerability resolutionii. Standardized reporting templates should be created that communicate vulnerability information, including context and content about the vulnerability, asset classification, vulnerability severity, potential impact and recommended remediation stepsiii. Reports can be tailored to the specific needs and interests of different stakeholder groups, such as security teams, application owners, and business stakeholdersiv. The distribution of vulnerability reports could be automated and sent to relevant stakeholders via email, secure file sharing platforms, or designated intranet channels</li>
  <li>All relevant stakeholders who need to be notified about vulnerability identification and remediation activities should be identified (e.g., security teams, product development teams, CSC support teams, and external auditors)vi. A notification protocol should be defined for alerting stakeholders about newly identified vulnerabilities. This protocol should specify the severity threshold for triggering notifications, the channels for communication, and the escalation process for critical vulnerabilitiesvii. A record of all notifications sent to stakeholders, including the date, time, recipient, and vulnerability details should be maintainedviii. Escalation procedures should exist for notifying senior management or external parties in the event of severe or widespread vulnerabilities</li>
