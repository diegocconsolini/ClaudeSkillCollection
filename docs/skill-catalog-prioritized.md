## ‚ùå NOT SUITABLE as Claude Skills

These require capabilities beyond document generation:

### Requires Live Scanning/Analysis:
- ‚ùå GDPR Compliance Auditor (needs to scan actual systems)
- ‚ùå Cookie Compliance Scanner (needs to analyze websites)
- ‚ùå Security Configuration Auditor (needs system access)
- ‚ùå Vulnerability Scanner (needs network access)
- ‚ùå Code Security Analyzer (needs to parse code)

### Requires External APIs/Services:
- ‚ùå Threat Intelligence Reporter (needs threat feeds)
- ‚ùå Dark Web Monitor (needs external data sources)
- ‚ùå Supply Chain Risk Analyzer (needs vendor databases)
- ‚ùå CVE Lookup Service (just API wrapper)

### Too Simple (Just Lookups):
- ‚ùå Encryption Standards Advisor (just a decision tree)
- ‚ùå Regulation Finder (just search)
- ‚ùå Compliance Calendar (just dates)
- ‚ùå Control Framework Mapper (simple mapping)

### Too Complex/Subjective:
- ‚ùå Risk Assessment Calculator (requires context-specific judgment)
