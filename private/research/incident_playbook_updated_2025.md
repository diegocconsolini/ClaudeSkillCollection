# Incident Response Playbook Creator - Updated Resource Guide (2025)

## ⚠️ Important Update: NIST SP 800-61 Rev 3 Released

**Critical Change:** NIST SP 800-61 Rev 2 was superseded by Rev 3 on April 3, 2025. However, both versions offer valuable resources for your skill development.

---

## 📊 Understanding NIST Rev 2 vs Rev 3

### NIST SP 800-61 Rev 3 (Current - April 2025)
**"Incident Response Recommendations and Considerations for Cybersecurity Risk Management: A CSF 2.0 Community Profile"**

**What it is:**
- Aligns with NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0
- Strategic framework for integrating IR into risk management
- Focus on organizational governance and continuous improvement
- Community Profile approach

**Best for your skill:**
- Understanding modern IR organizational structure
- CSF 2.0 alignment for enterprise customers
- Risk management integration
- Governance frameworks

**Key change:** No longer provides step-by-step tactical procedures

### NIST SP 800-61 Rev 2 (Withdrawn but Still Valuable)
**"Computer Security Incident Handling Guide"**

**What it was:**
- Practical, hands-on incident handling procedures
- Step-by-step guidance through IR lifecycle
- Specific technical recommendations
- Real-world examples and scenarios

**Still valuable for your skill:**
- **Tactical playbook templates** (exactly what you need!)
- **Communication templates**
- **Escalation procedures**
- **Technical response steps**
- **Incident categorization**

### 💡 Recommended Approach for Your Skill

**Use BOTH versions strategically:**

1. **Rev 3** - For strategic framework and CSF alignment
2. **Rev 2** - For tactical templates and procedures
3. **Industry sources** - For current technical details

## 🔄 How Rev 3 Changes Your Skill Design

### New Considerations for Your Playbook Generator:

1. **CSF 2.0 Alignment Options**
   ```python
   playbook_config = {
       'framework_alignment': 'CSF 2.0',  # New option
       'csf_functions': {
           'govern': ['GV.OC', 'GV.RM', 'GV.RR'],
           'identify': ['ID.AM', 'ID.RA', 'ID.IM'],
           'protect': ['PR.AA', 'PR.AT', 'PR.DS'],
           'detect': ['DE.CM', 'DE.AE', 'DE.DP'],
           'respond': ['RS.MA', 'RS.AN', 'RS.MI', 'RS.CO', 'RS.IM'],
           'recover': ['RC.RP', 'RC.IM', 'RC.CO']
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Dual-Mode Playbook Generation**
   ```python
   class PlaybookGenerator:
       def __init__(self, mode='hybrid'):
           """
           mode options:
           - 'tactical': Rev 2 style step-by-step procedures
           - 'strategic': Rev 3 CSF-aligned governance
           - 'hybrid': Both approaches (recommended)
           """
           self.mode = mode
   ```

3. **Updated Lifecycle Model**
   ```yaml
   # Rev 3 Model (CSF-aligned)
   lifecycle_rev3:
     preparation:
       - govern
       - identify
       - protect
     response:
       - detect
       - respond
       - recover
     improvement:
       - identify.im  # Continuous improvement
   
   # Rev 2 Model (Still valid for procedures)
   lifecycle_rev2:
     - preparation
     - detection_analysis
     - containment_eradication_recovery
     - post_incident
   ```

## 📚 Resource Mapping Strategy

### For Strategic Elements (Use Rev 3 + CSF 2.0):
- Governance structures
- Risk management integration
- Organizational policies
- Performance metrics
- Continuous improvement

### For Tactical Procedures (Use Rev 2 + Industry):
- Detection indicators
- Containment steps
- Eradication procedures
- Recovery checklists
- Communication scripts

### For Current Threats (Use CISA + Vendors):
- Ransomware TTPs (2025)
- Cloud-specific incidents
- Supply chain attacks
- Zero-day responses
- AI-related incidents

## 💡 Key Takeaways for Your Skill

1. **Don't abandon Rev 2** - Its tactical guidance is still gold for creating playbook templates
2. **Add CSF 2.0 options** - Many organizations now require CSF alignment
3. **Offer both approaches** - Let users choose tactical vs strategic focus
4. **Stay current on threats** - Use CISA and vendor resources for 2025 attack patterns
5. **Version your templates** - Mark which framework version they align with

---

## 🚀 Practical Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Core Templates (Week 1)
- Extract tactical procedures from Rev 2 (still valid!)
- Build basic playbook structure
- Create communication templates

### Phase 2: CSF Integration (Week 2)
- Add CSF 2.0 function mapping from Rev 3
- Create governance templates
- Add risk management elements

### Phase 3: Modernization (Week 3)
- Add 2025 threat scenarios from CISA
- Include cloud-specific procedures
- Add AI/ML incident considerations

---

## 📋 Compliance Considerations

Your playbooks should now address:
- **Traditional**: Rev 2 step-by-step procedures
- **Modern**: Rev 3 CSF 2.0 alignment
- **Regulatory**: GDPR 72-hour, CCPA, SEC 8-K (2024 rules)
- **Industry**: Sector-specific requirements

## ✅ Action Items

1. **Download both NIST versions** - You need both perspectives
2. **Map to CSF 2.0** - Add framework alignment options
3. **Keep procedures from Rev 2** - They're still technically accurate
4. **Add governance from Rev 3** - For enterprise alignment
5. **Update threat scenarios** - Use 2025 CISA guidance
6. **Test both modes** - Tactical and strategic outputs

---

## 📝 Note on Documentation Currency

- **Strategic framework**: Use Rev 3 (April 2025)
- **Tactical procedures**: Rev 2 still valid (procedures haven't changed)
- **Threat scenarios**: Use 2024-2025 sources only
- **Regulatory**: Check for 2025 updates (SEC, GDPR guidance)

Remember: The withdrawal of Rev 2 doesn't invalidate its tactical guidance - it just means the strategic framework has evolved. Use both wisely!
