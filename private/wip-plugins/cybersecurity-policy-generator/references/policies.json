Enterprises need many types of data to make business decisions, and when that data is not available or is untrusted, then it could impact the enterprise. An easy example is weather information to a transportation enterprise. When attackers compromise assets, they make changes to configurations, add accounts, and often add software or scripts. These changes are not always easy to identify, as attackers might have corrupted or replaced trusted applications with malicious versions, or the changes might appear to be standard-looking account names. Configuration changes can include adding or changing registry entries, opening ports, turning off security services, deleting logs, or other malicious actions that make a system insecure. These actions do not have to be malicious; human error can cause each of these as well. Therefore, it is important to have an ability to have recent backups or mirrors to recover enterprise assets and data back to a known trusted state.\nPurpose\nThe CIS Critical Security Controls ® (CIS Controls ® ) recommends several policies that an enterprise should have in place as foundational elements of its cybersecurity program . This Data Recovery Policy is meant as a “jumping off point” for enterprises that need help draft ing their own enterprise data recovery polic y . Enterprises are encouraged to use this policy template in whole or in part. With that said, there are multiple decisions points and areas that must be tailored to your enterprise. In CIS Controls v8, Control 11 states:\nControl 11 – Data Recovery\nEstablish and maintain data recovery practices sufficient to restore in-scope enterprise assets to a pre-incident and trusted state .\nTo support this Safeguard, it i s important for an enterprise to develop a D ata R ecovery Policy . This document may include detailed steps for planning, taking backups, testing them, and actually recovering from an incident . Additionally, there should also be a portion of the policy that integrates with the I ncident response plan, and other associated compliance and communication plans. This document support s the development of a process for managing and protecting recovery data in the enterprise and the implementation of S afeguard s in this CIS Control .\nScope\nThis policy template is meant to supplement the CIS Controls v8. The policy statements included within this document can be used by all CIS Implementation Groups (IGs ) but are specifically geared towards Safeguards in Implementation Group 1 (IG1) . In Appendix D , Safeguards unique to IG1 are specifically highlighted for ease of use. For more information on the CIS Implementation Groups, see Appendix C . Additionally, a glossary in Appendix B is provided for guidance on terminology used throughout the document. Future versions of this template may expand the scope to both Implementation Group 2 (IG2) Safeguards. IG2 and IG3 enterprises may feel the need to add sections that go beyond IG1 and are welcome to do so. Depending on an enterprise’s sector or mission, other policy statements may also need to be added or removed. This is encouraged as this policy needs to be molded and fit to the enterprise’s needs.\nData Recovery Lifecycle\nFor the safety and longevity of the enterprise, data recovery should not be left to a haphazard, slow-moving process that gets done when it’s done. In order to ensure that an enterprise can quickly recover from an incident and continue with its mission, a Data Recovery Policy must be put into place. Show n below in Figure 1 are the high-level “steps” of the Data Recovery Lifecycle , followed by a detailed description of what each step entails.\nFigure 1 . Data Recovery Lifecycle\nPlan – Create a detailed course of action to handle an overall backup strategy .\nBackup – Take backups from enterprise assets and transferring them to other data storage locations .\nTest – Ensur e that the backup strategy is functioning as planned. This includes ensuring that the intended data is appropriately stored and is recoverable within the timeframes established by the data recovery plan.\nRecover – Execut e the plan for recovery plan and get the right data back into the hands of the enterprise. Also feeds back into the planning phase.\nPlan\nOne of the primary aspects of recovery planning is understanding what your recovery objectives are. Essentially, w hat data and enterprise assets are most important to your enterprise’s mission and how quickly does your enterprise need systems and their data at operational status . Meeting large, complex, and quick continuity objectives will likely require much planning and resources to meet. Data owners outlined in the Data Management Policy must be consulted to understand any impacts on data recovery . The Enterprise Asset Inventory and Data Asset Inventory can be used to help guide these prioritization discussions, since these two inventories will contain what data is already labeled most sensitive to an enterprise’s success and what assets that data resides on. These assets and data should be plainly laid out in the data recovery plan and should include backups for data stored in third-party service provider infrastructure, such as cloud platforms . Cloud service providers (CSPs) often stipulate that they do not own or are responsible for the data housed on their platforms, meaning that if the data is lost; it may be lost indefinitely . It is best to double-check with the CSP prior to onboarding to ensure that this is in-line with the enterprise’s policies .\nData recovery planning should also include the types of data storage to be used for backup purposes, where that data will geographically reside once backed up, and necessary security controls to be applied to that data to protect it from unauthorized access. Cloud storage for data backups is an adequate solution, but enterprises should verify that the data is actually stored elsewhere. Even if cloud storage is used as a primary backup strategy, there needs to be a plan for network isolated, offsite backups. The reason for this is twofold: 1) preventing ransomware that enters the network from encrypting backups and 2) preventing fire s or other natural disaster s from destroying backups .\nBackup\nThis part of the data recovery lifecycle includes taking data from enterprise assets and storing this data elsewhere. A backup is a duplicate of a computer system’s data, but different types and degrees of backups exist. A backup is commonly viewed as a small collection of a system’s overall data. Often only a few important folders are backed up, such as containing photos, receipts, contracts, or tax information. This data may be stored on another computer system, external hard drive, removable media, or cloud service. This strategy is insufficient for protecting an enterprise . Instead, a complete system image is a snapshot of all data and settings on a system, is preferred. Flavors of backups include incremental, differential, or complete .\nIf a system is breached by an attacker, infected with malware, or involved in an accident (e.g., fire, flood), it often takes a long time to bring a system or network back online. This could include reinstalling and reconfiguring all the enterprise systems and applications. Complete system backups rectify this issue by backing up not just important folders, but by backing up the entire computer, which can be pushed to new systems. Although this approach is a more complex solution, it makes recovery from a disaster or computer incident significantly faster. Backups protect against many malware types including ransomware and destructive malware. Using tools and service to perform automated backups is now commonplace and is an activity worth the time to setup and manage.\nLacking specific guidance to dictate the length of retention of data from production system , enterprise data can become cumbersome to manage, which may lead to accidental data loss or mismanagement. This is in part due to data being stored essentially everywhere nowadays including within the enterprise, outside the enterprise, and with third-party service providers. Additionally, removal of sensitive data no longer being used lessens the impact of a data breach since less data will be available to be stolen on enterprise assets. Data retention schedules within the Data Management Policy should also consider the data contained within backups, as this data may not need to be saved and archived for an ill-defined amount of time. Enterprises should work to understand the relevant laws regarding data retention and their enterprise, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This is especially so if they are housing data that is covered by special legislation, such as medical data . Certain laws may specify timeframes that enterprises must keep data safe or mandate specific methods of destruction.\nTest\nTesting that a backup exists, was properly taken, and that the data within can be successfully restore d is essential to a successful restoration. This ensures that, if needed, the backups will be able to restore what has been corrupted or destroyed. Too often backups are untested and can’t actually be restored in times of crisis. IT should develop testing procedures to ensure that backups taken can be restored and used without excessive time and resources. The testing process should ensure that all parties with recovery responsibilities within IT understand the prioritized recovery objectives.\nRecover\nAs part of data recovery planning , enterprises should ensure that lines of communications exist between individuals charged with recovery activities and leadership roles. Additionally, granular milestones for data recovery objectives should be created to help show progress and divide recovery activities into more manageable chunks. Once an incident occurs that necessitates recovery, the data recovery plan should be put into action and implemented just as it was tested and validated. The data recovery team should work to improve the d ata r ecovery p lan after an incident in order to continuously better the plan. Data recovery teams should proceed with caution when leveraging data that was touched by malicious attackers. This data may have been subtly modified or “poisoned” in some way. It may be best to recover from data untouched by attackers . Recovery planning and communication should be considered as part of the Incident Response Policy .\nFurther Discussion\nRansomware and Destructive Malware\nOver the past few years, ransomware (a subset of malware) has gained popularity in plaguing enterprises. There are several ransomware types. The most popular form of ransomware uses cryptography to block access to a system’s data via encryption, preventing enterprises from accessing their own data and requiring money to obtain access to the data. This type of ransomware requires affected enterprises to pay money in order to regain access to their data. Other ransomware types may instead block access and never provide it ever again, called locker ransomware or destructive malware. Double extortion ransomware has also gained popularity in the past few years, where attackers deploy ransomware to encrypt the enterprise’s data and additionally threaten to exfiltrate the enterprise’s data. This is a tactic used by attackers to try and scare enterprises into paying the ransom. In any of these scenarios, if the data is never provided back, it is considered destructive malware .\nBesides user education and antivirus software, one of the best ways to recover from the impact of ransomware is backing up data to another system before there is a problem. But backups alone would not completely prevent this malware from accomplishing its goals. Typical backups may be connected to another system or network, meaning backup data can still be attacked. Therefore, regular backups should be stored in an unconnected, off-the-network, manner. Keeping offline backups helps enterprise’s recover and restore systems when ransomware or destructive malware hits a system. A common way for this malware to get into a network is to be installed via email attachments or drive-by downloads from websites. Both of these types of malware have impacted law enforcement, hospitals, governments, and academic institutions and cost millions of dollars to recover. Leveraging the guidance within the CIS Controls will help reduce the risk of ransomware through improved cyber hygiene, as attackers usually use older or basic exploits on insecure systems.\nReplication vs Backup\nBacking up data and data replication are two separate processes, and it is worthwhile to understand the distinction between them . D ata backup s will ensure that a second copy of data exists elsewhere within an enterprise. Best practice for data backups ensure s that at least one off-network backup of all critical data is available at all times. Data backups typically represent discrete moments in time when the data was copied from one device to another device or storage medium. Backups may be stored on tape, hard drives, cloud infrastructure, or a specialized storage appliance. If an incident occurs after a computer incident or natural disaster, all data since the last backup may be lost.\nIn contrast to data backups, d ata replication provides significant gains in reliability and uptime . In the instance of replication , data replication is the “process of writing data to two separate locations . Data replication is often configured to occur in real time in order to keep the most up - to - dat e available to the enterprise in the event of an incident. This is often used as a way to keep a disaster recovery hot site up and running providing resiliency against computer incidents and natural disasters . Data replication often requires additional infrastructure and resources in order to function, but any hot sites can be operational in minutes after an incident.\nWhile data replication may have certain advantages over data backups, this does not mean that data backups are not worth the effort. Any sort of backup process is better than none, especially with the continuous ransomware issues plaguing computer networks throughout the world. It’s common for enterprises to begin with data backups and move to a more advanced process over time.\nCloud- B ased Backup Strategies\nCloud-based storage strategies are becoming more commonplace with the heavy reliance on cloud platforms in general. There’s a wide array of recovery features offered by the large cloud platforms, with some being offered for free whereas other features may be offered with additional cost such as sophisticated data analytics and integration with other technology that an enterprise may be leveraging. There are two models that are often discussed with backing up data: Software as a Service (SaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS). In SaaS models, enterprises leverage an application or capability that a cloud platform is offering. With PaaS scenarios, an enterprise would leverage the underlying cloud infrastructure to build tools and services with the technology the cloud service provider makes available.\nData Recovery Policy Template\nPurpose\nProper planning will help an enterprise recover from different types of cybersecurity events or natural disasters in a timely manner . Th is Data Recovery Policy provides an overarching strategy for governing the backup and recovery of data within the enterprise . This includes creating a detailed data recovery process to ensure data is backed up on the correct assets . This process should be documented and be quickly available in case an incident occurs. Additionally, procedures for securely protecting data from unauthorized access or modification alongside appropriate methods for how users should handle their data during their day-to-day work activities.\nResponsibility\nThis policy is applicable to all users and IT assets. Specifically,\nThe IT business unit is responsible for a majority of data recovery functions.\nUsers are responsible for ensuring their enterprise data is appropriately backed up in accordance with enterprise requirements .",

(CIS ® ).\nIntroduction\nA comprehensive cybersecurity program includes protections, detections, response, and recovery capabilities. Often, the final two get overlooked in immature enterprises, or the response technique to compromised systems is just to re-image them to original state, and move on. The primary goal of incident response is to identify threats on the enterprise, respond to them before they can spread, and remediate them before they can cause harm. Without understanding the full scope of an incident, how it happened, and what can be done to prevent it from happening again, defenders will just be in a perpetual “whack-a-mole” pattern.\nWe cannot expect our protections to be effective 100% of the time. When an incident occurs, if an enterprise does not have a documented plan—even with good people—it is almost impossible to know the right investigative procedures, reporting, data collection, management responsibility, legal protocols, and communications strategy that will allow the enterprise to successfully understand, manage, and recover.\nAlong with detection, containment, and eradication, communication to stakeholders is key. If we are to reduce the probability of material impact due to a cyber event, the enterprise’s leadership must know what potential impact there could be, so that they can help prioritize remediation or restoration decisions that best support the enterprise. These business decisions could be based on regulatory compliance, disclosure rules, service-level agreements with partners or customers, revenue, or mission impacts.\nDwell time from when an attack happens to when it is identified can be days, weeks, or months. The longer the attacker is in the enterprise’s infrastructure, the more embedded they become and they will develop more ways to maintain persistent access for when they are eventually discovered. With the rise of ransomware, which is a stable moneymaker for attackers, this dwell time is critical, especially with modern tactics of stealing data before encrypting it for ransom.\nPurpose\nThe CIS Critical Security Controls® (CIS Controls®) recommend multiple information security policies that an enterprise should have in place. This Incident Response Policy is meant as a “jumping off point” for organizations needing to draft their own policies , and provides specific, high-level steps that should be part of any comprehensive incident response plan . Enterprises are encouraged to use this policy template in whole or in part. With that said, there are multiple decision points and areas that must be tailored to your enterprise .\nEvents vs Incidents\nThere are many ways to define an incident. The authors of this document consider the following factors when defining an incident :\nA n event or situation, either intentional or unintentional , internal to the enterprise or external,\nCaused by an individual, enterprise , nation state, or natural event that ,\nI mpact s an enterprise’s ability to accomplish its mission (critically or otherwise ) , and\nThis event may or may not l ead to loss of data .\nExamples of deliberate hacking incident s include attacks against Supermarket Chain Coop’s and those affected by the SolarWinds Attacks . Incidents aren’t always hacking-oriented as was the case with a French data center that was affected by fires , meaning n atural disasters can also trigger the incident response plan. I t can sometimes be difficult to interpret something as an event or an incident . NIST defines an incident as a “ cybersecurity event that has been determined to have an impact on the organization prompting the need for response and recovery . ” Some view an event a s any occurrence that can be observed, verified, and documented, whereas an incident is one or more related events that negatively affect the company and/or impact its security posture . Sometimes one business unit within an enterprise will interpret an action as an event whereas another business unit will define it as an incident . This distinction matters, as an incident will trigger different enterprise responses , such as activating the incident response plan. Having clearly established definitions of events versus incident can be very beneficial for this reason . For example, an enterprise may determine that anytime leadership is actively involved in an event, it will be classified as an incident. Ultimately, this is a judgement call. Note that events can become incidents as more information is gathered.\nScope\nThis policy template is meant to supplement the CIS Controls v8. The policy statements included within this document can be used by all CIS Implementation Groups (IGs) , but are geared towards Safeguards in Implementation Group 1 (IG1) . Additional Safeguards from IG2 are included within this policy template, since they are commonly included as requirements from cyber insurance providers. These Safeguards are 17.4, 17.5, and 17.6. A mapping for Safeguards to the CIS Controls can be found in Appendix D . For more information on the CIS Implementation Groups, see Appendix C . Additionally, a glossary in Appendix B is provided for guidance on terminology used throughout the document. Future versions of this template may expand the scope to both Implementation Group 2 (IG2) Safeguards. IG2 and IG3 enterprises may feel the need to add sections that go beyond IG1, and are welcome to do so. Depending on an enterprise’s sector or mission, other policy statements may also need to be added or removed. This is encouraged as this policy needs to be molded and fit to the enterprise’s needs.\nIncident Response Plan Lifecycle\nThis Incident Response Policy Template is divided into multiple sections based on usage patterns of assets within an enterprise. There are many ways to organize the incident response process. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) provides one, as does NIST 800-61 Revision 2: Computer Security Incident Handling Guide . The lifecycle presented below in Figure 1 is an abstracted way to view the incident response process and house the policy statements provided by this document in an organized manner. H igh-level “steps” of the incident responses p rocess are presented , followed by a detailed description of what each step entails.\nFigure 1 . Incident Response Process\nPlan – Develop documentation for all procedures necessary to handle an incident.\nDetect – Monitor enterprise assets and analyze intelligence to understand if an incident has occurred .\nRespond – Activate the incident response plan to deal with an incident.\nUpdate – Understand which portions of the incident response plan have been effective or not, and update the plan accordingly.\nPlan\nWhen a n incident occurs, the first step is to consult the incident response plan for the next steps that the enterprise should take. The plan should remain available in case enterprise systems are no longer functioning as intended; common methods include storing the plan on an external system or keeping a paper copy on hand. An incident will be a stressful time and this plan should provide step -b y - step instructions that prevents guesswork during the heat of the moment . There are variety of incident response plans available online that enterprises can consult when writing their own plan. Plans will vary from enterprise to enterprise, but the level of detail will often be dictated by the maturity of the cybersecurity program. One of the most common aspects of an incident response plan is to name specific individuals to perform defined functions during this process. There will likely need to be someone who is responsible for the entire process, often the incident manager . Any external support from third parties should also be named , which often includes contractors or technical organizations offering support . Detailed c ontact information should be provided for all individuals named in the plan. Once written, this plan will change over time as experience is gained , and the process gradually iterates to be in sync with the needs of the enterprise. Testing the plan via tabletop exercises is a great way to gain familiarity with the plan.\nWhile larger enterprises may place procedures for responding to a natural disaster within a business continuity plan, smaller enterprises may place these policies within the incident response plan. Either approach is acceptable, and enterprises are encouraged to seek out how this is typically done in similar enterprise s in their localities. Regulatory requirements may specifically note where these policies and procedures belong.\nThere is a need for a defined process for a user to report any identified event, or potential event . This process should be documented to facilitate clarity and ease of implementation . This is a separate plan or process from the Incident Response Plan. Users should be taught this process during the mandatory training for security awareness , therefore it m ust be easy to implement . The information should also be placed on internal intranet places and other logical places that would make the information readily available and accessible to all users .\nDetect\nDetecting if an incident occurred is difficult. Especially if the attack was subtle from advanced actors. To combat this, enterprises typically leverage a variety of methods to identify incidents such as data , anti-malware, and security awareness training. Data will often take the form of logs that must be analyzed. These logs may contain information to help you understand if an incident has occurred. Anti-malware tools such as endpoint detection and response (EDR) are tailor made for detecting these types of attacks. Finally, employees should be regularly trained on how to spot and report incidents. This means that IT must m onitor employee reports of computer incidents and actively investigate such reports.\nRespond\nOnce an incident has been reported or detected , IT , or the business units charged with security, must a ctiv ate the incident response plan as developed in the planning phase . This response also begins the recovery process. The response team will often be composed of internal and external users all working to gether to carry out the incident response plan. It’s common for smaller enterprises to contact any contractors helping to manage its IT infrastructure or any state/federal government entities offering free or low-cost services . Ultimately, the individual specified in the i ncident r esponse p lan as the i ncident manager is charged with e nsur ing the incident has been properly managed and is following established standard operating procedures ( S O Ps ) . It’s best practice for the incident manager to be an individual trained in incident response with excellent communication skills , the capacity to prioritize the incident. This individual must have the authority to communicate business impacts with external organizations such as lawyers, regulators, cyber insurance companies, local cyber incident response teams ( C I RT ) and potentially law enforcement. Generally, this is not a senior executive ; but this is not always practical with smaller entities . External incident response expertise may be required. This individual will also be responsible for making the determination that the incident has come to a conclusion .\nUpdate\nThe update phase of this lifecycle ensures that the incident response plan and process is gradually improving from the experiences of recent incidents , tabletop exercises, and scheduled regular review . Lessons learned from recent incidents should be discussed with the individuals involved in the incident response process. A ppropriate changes to the incident response plan based on recent incidents should be made, alongside the standard operating procedures. Where applicable, communicate and train staff on changes to the IR plan . During the incident response process , it’s common for data to be collected and used to help guide actions of all involved. These collected data artifacts should be archived or deleted in a manner consistent with the D ata M anagement P olic y and document ed it in the custodial chain of evidence if appropriate .\nIncident Response Policy Template\nPurpose\nIncident response includes planning for and actively managing incidents that can prevent an enterprise from leveraging its assets to meet its goals. Most commonly this takes the form of unauthorized access into a computer system , physical security intrusions, or if a natural disaster occurs . The Incident Response Policy provides the processes and procedures for ensuring incidents are properly handled with as little impact to the enterprise as possible, and to begin the recovery plan . This policy applies to all departments and all assets connected to the enterprise network.\nResponsibility\nThe IT business unit is responsible for managing all incident response functions.\nWhile a ll IT staff are required to follow the written incident response plan , real world deviations are expected and must be handled gracefully. Third - party organizations involved in the incident response process must be managed by the incident manager .\nUsers are responsible for reporting incidents that they are aware of to the appropriate business unit or personnel as specified in the incident reporting process. Users are responsible for attending training for recognizing and reporting incidents within the enterprise.",

Permissive settings, open services and ports, default accounts or passwords, older (vulnerable) protocols, and pre-installation of unnecessary software can all be exploitable if left in their default state. Further, these security configuration updates need to be managed and maintained over the life time of all enterprise assets and software. Configuration updates need to be tracked and approved through a configuration management workflow process to maintain a record that can be reviewed for compliance, leveraged for incident response, and to support audits. Secure configurations are important to on-premises devices, as well as remote devices, network devices, and cloud environments.\nPurpose\nThe CIS Critical Security Controls ® (CIS Controls ® ) include multiple policies that an enterprise should have in place. This policy applies to CIS Control 4 – Secure Configuration of Enterprise Assets and Software . Safeguards 4.1 and 4.2 state:\n4.1 - Establish and Maintain a Secure Configuration Process\nEstablish and maintain a secure configuration process for enterprise assets (end-user devices, including portable and mobile; non-computing/IoT devices; and servers) and software (operating systems and applications). Review and update documentation annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard .\n4.2 - Establish and Maintain a Secure Configuration Process for Network Infrastructure\nEstablish and maintain a secure configuration process for network devices. Review and update documentation annually, or when significant enterprise changes occur that could impact this Safeguard.\nThis policy is meant as a “jumping off point” for enterprises needing to draft their own secure configuration management policies. Enterprises are encouraged to use this policy template in whole or in part. With that said, there are multiple decisions points and areas that must be tailored to your enterprise ; some of which are explored by this document.\nConfigurable Devices\nEnterprise assets are often not set up by default in the most secure configuration. This is often done to provide flexibility for their customers to apply their own secure configurations in accordance with their own security policies, but also to ensure the product functions “out of the box”. Therefore, the presence of default accounts or passwords, excessive access, or unnecessary services are common in default configurations. These could introduce weaknesses that are under the responsibility of the enterprise using the asset. Even after a strong initial configuration is developed and applied, it must be continually managed to avoid degrading security as software is updated or patched, new security vulnerabilities are reported, and configurations are “tweaked,” to allow the installation of new software or to support new operational requirements.\nThere are a variety of enterprise, software, and other assets and services that may require configuration. These include hardware, software, and third-party services. Common examples include:\nOperating system configuration: This includes modifying the settings for the common operating systems such as Microsoft® Windows, Apple® MacOS, and the various flavors of Linux® and Unix. Smartphones, tablets, wearables, and internet of things (IoT) devices may all be configurable to various extents.\nApplications: Software written for any platform may require configuration. This includes software written for laptops, servers, smartphones, tablets, wearables, and IoT devices. Databases, hypervisors, and, virtual machines may also be included.\nCloud services and platforms: Third-party service providers may provide entire platforms that can be configured. These platforms may also provide individual applications that may be configured.\nNetwork appliances: These all-in-one physical boxes aids in the flow to network connected devices. These include routers, switches, firewalls, wireless access points (WAPs).\nScope\nThis policy template is meant to supplement the CIS Controls v8. The policy statements included within this document can be used by all CIS Implementation Groups (IGs ) but are specifically geared towards Safeguards in Implementation Group 1 (IG1) . In Appendix D , Safeguards unique to IG1 are specifically highlighted for ease of use. For more information on the CIS Implementation Groups, see Appendix C . Additionally, a glossary in Appendix B is provided for guidance on terminology used throughout the document. Future versions of this template may expand the scope to both Implementation Group 2 (IG2) Safeguards. IG2 and IG3 enterprises may feel the need to add sections that go beyond IG1 and are welcome to do so. Depending on an enterprise’s sector or mission, other policy statements may also need to be added or removed. This is encouraged as this policy needs to be molded and fit to the enterprise’s needs.\nSecure Configuration Management Process\nThere are many ways to create a secure configuration process. This policy divides the process into four smaller elements to help enterprises develop a process that works for them. The process used by this Policy Template is as follows:\nFigure 1 . Secure Configuration Management Process Diagram\nPlan – Creating a process to identify secure configuration baselines, implement them, and then monitor their performance. This may also include creating secure configurations for specific technologies\nImplement – Using the secure configuration baselines that were selected, by implementing recommended changes to the various technologies within the enterprise. This should include a validation process to ensure the configuration baselines conform to expectations.\nMonitor – As systems are updated and change over time, secure configurations need to be updated. These changes need to be reviewed before implementation .\nModify – Ensuring a particular system is in - line with the approved baseline. This may include discovering new assets or detecting unauthorized changes to a system.\nPlan\nCreating and implementing a process for secure configurations can be difficult. Nearly all the devices in an enterprise can be configured to some extent. All the devices within an enterprise asset inventory, alongside all the software applications within the software inventory, will require some level of configuration. Yet not all assets are equal in importance. Configuring certain assets before others may be logical if that asset is storing or processing sensitive information. Deciding what to configure, how to do it, and when to double check configurations, all falls under the planning element of the secure configuration process.\nAn enterprise needs to identify and approve secure configuration baselines for all technologies it uses. Secure configuration may be provided from the vendor of a product or service or may be provided by a trusted external organization such as CIS. If no guidance is available, enterprises should perform their own research before using a product. This may lead to the enterprise developing their own configuration guidance. Areas to investigate for secure configuration may include:\nAnti-malware capabilities\nAccess control, include user accounts and authentication credentials\nEncryption\nLogging\nLeast privilege\nLeveraging hardware security capabilities when possible\nDisabling of unused services, applications, and functionality\nNetwork connections\nAutomatic session locking\nRemoval default accounts\nImplement\nOnce secure configuration baselines are created and/or selected, IT staff need to configure the technologies in accordance with the baselines. This often involves accessing configuration settings and admin panels within operating systems, firewalls, and other systems. Each element in an approved baseline will need to be implemented and must be tracked by IT staff as required by the enterprise. Some baselines require changes that an enterprise cannot support, such as turning off a necessary feature. Analyzing which baseline modifications can and cannot be made is a process known as “tailoring ” and is quite normal. IT will need to keep track of their new and modified baseline. Automated tools can be used to simpl if y this process and ensure each change is put into place methodically and without error.\nMonitor\nEnterprise assets need to be regularly reviewed for deviations from an approved secure configuration. This can be done manually, or with automated tools. Manual monitoring may include an audit of enterprise assets on a regular, predefined schedule. A change configuration process will ensure only appropriate modifications are made to enterprise assets and that these changes do not introduce vulnerabilities or introduce system instability and/or failure into a network. These changes may need to be tested before being put into production within an enterprise, but some enterprises will be unable to test beforehand.\nModify\nOnce the monitoring phase is complete, changes need to be made accordingly. Certain configuration changes may require patches and other software updates that will push the enterprise back to the Implement phase. In addition to making changes identified in the monitoring phase, enterprises will need to keep secure configuration baselines up to date. New versions of software and systems will be released on a regular schedule and need to be re-configured. New baselines will need to be analyzed and reapproved.\nFurther Discussion and Resources\nAutomated Tooling for Secure Configuration\nCommercial and/or free configuration management tools, such as the CIS Configuration Assessment Tool (CIS-CAT®) , https://learn.cisecurity.org/cis-cat-lite , can be deployed to measure the settings of operating systems and applications of managed machines to look for deviations from the standard image configurations. Commercial configuration management tools use some combination of an agent installed on each managed system, or agentless inspection of systems through remotely logging into each enterprise asset using administrator credentials. Additionally, a hybrid approach is sometimes used whereby a remote session is initiated, a temporary or dynamic agent is deployed on the target system for the scan, and then the agent is removed. Note that this tool is free for US state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) governments to use but is a commercial product.\nSecure Configuration Management Policy Template\nPurpose\nSecure configurations are used to remove default accounts, passwords, unnecessary services , and other functionality that ship with default configurations in products used by the enterprise. These default configurations may introduce weaknesses that are under the responsibility of the enterprise using the assets. Additionally, secure configurations sometimes enable security-relevant tools and settings that are not available by default. Th is Secure Configuration Management Policy provides the processes and procedures for identifying, applying, and maintaining secure configurations throughout the lifetime all asset and services .\nResponsibility\nIT is responsible for all secure configurations. This information is relayed to other business units within the enterprise such as finance, accounting, and cybersecurity as required or needed. IT is responsible for informing all users of their responsibilities in the use of any assets assigned to them.",

S oftware asset management is a difficult problem for an enterprise of any size. New software is constantly acquired within an enterprise . S oftware must be maintained, updated, and ultimately uninstalled. Additionally, users may attempt to install unauthorized software on enterprise assets. With work from home becoming more prominent, software may be regularly used on enterprise assets that are not actively connected to the enterprise network. This necessitates that software may be managed by an enterprise’s I nformation T echnology (IT) personnel\nPurpose\nThe Center for Internet Security ® (CIS ® ) recommends several policies that an enterprise should have in place. One of those policies, a Software Asset Management Policy , is meant as a “jumping off point” for enterprises that need help draft ing their own software asset management polic y . Enterprises are encouraged to use this policy template in whole or in part. With that said, there are multiple decisions points and areas that must be tailored to your enterprise. As an example, deciding and documenting which “departments” or “business units” are responsible for asset management. In CIS Controls v8, Control 2 states:\nControl 2 – Inventory and Control of Software Assets\nActively manage (inventory, track, and correct) all software (operating systems and applications) on the network so that only authorized software is installed and can execute, and that unauthorized and unmanaged software is found and prevented from installation or execution.\nTo support this Safeguard, it is important for an enterprise to develop a software asset management process. This process should include establishing and maintaining a detailed software asset inventory, ensuring that software is currently supported (e.g., not end-of-life or end-of-support), and addressing unauthorized software, at a minimum. This document supports the development of a process for managing software assets and the implementation of this CIS Control.\nTypes of Software Assets\nThere are many types of software assets that can exist on enterprise assets. For the purposes of this document and as defined in t he CIS Critical Security Controls ® (CIS Controls ® ) , a software asset (or software, for short) are the programs and other operating information used within an enterprise asset .\nSoftware assets include both operating systems and applications. An operating system is system software on enterprise assets that manages computer hardware and software resources, and provides common services for programs. Operating systems are considered a software asset and can be single- and multi-tasking, single- and multi-user, distributed, templated, embedded, real-time, and library. An application is a program, or group of programs, hosted on enterprise assets and designed for end users. Applications are considered a software asset in this document. Examples include web, database, cloud-based, and mobile applications.\nAdditionally, there are multiple components that make up applications and operating systems, including services and libraries. A service refers to a software functionality or a set of software functionalities, such as the retrieval of specified information or the execution of a set of operations. Services provide a mechanism to enable access to one or more capabilities, where the access is provided using a prescribed interface and based on the identity of the requestor per the enterprise’s usage policies. A library is pre-written code, classes, procedures, scripts, configuration data, and more, used to develop software programs and applications. It is designed to assist both the programmer and the programming language compiler in building and executing software\nFigure . Software assets, as defined in CIS Controls v8\nThere are also several different types of software. The definitions revolve around the software owner, cost, and the ability to modify and redistribute the code. The following provides general definitions for different software types:\nFree software: Completely free to download, modify, distribute, and use software.\nFreeware: No-cost software that often includes a limited license to specific groups of users (e.g., students). Modification of source code is generally prohibited.\nOpen source: Free software for download and use, but the license will dictate stipulations for modification and redistribution.\nCommercial off the Shelf (COTS) software: Software that is publicly available for purchase. Patrons are generally not authorized to modify the software.\nInternally developed applications: Software applications created and maintained by an enterprise and their contractors. The enterprise generally owns all rights save for any licenses used in development stipulating otherwise.\nShareware: Often a type of software offered with a time-limited license, and potentially limited feature sets. Full versions are made available for purchase.\nScripts (e.g., PowerShell, Bash): A program that provides a series of instructions to the operating system, typically to accomplish a series of more basic tasks.\nScope\nThis policy template is meant to supplement the CIS Controls v8. The policy statements included within this document can be used by all CIS Implementation Groups (IGs) , but are specifically geared towards Safeguards in Implementation Group 1 (IG1) . In Appendix D , Safeguards unique to IG1 are specifically highlighted for ease of use. For more information on the CIS Implementation Groups, see Appendix C . Additionally, a glossary in Appendix B is provided for guidance on terminology used throughout the document. Future versions of this template may expand the scope to both Implementation Group 2 (IG2) Safeguards. IG2 and IG3 enterprises may feel the need to add sections that go beyond IG1, and are welcome to do so. Depending on an enterprise’s sector or mission, other policy statements may also need to be added or removed. This is encouraged as this policy needs to be molded and fit to the enterprise’s needs.\nSoftware Asset Management Lifecycle\nShown below in Figure 2 are the high-level “steps” of the Software Asset Lifecycle, followed by a detailed description of what each step entails. Identifying and tracking software assets is an important process in the Software Asset Management Lifecycle. In order to protect a network and its assets, an enterprise must first know what software is on a network. In addition, many other security controls are dependent on the software asset inventory, such as secure configurations, account management, access control, and more.\nFigure . Software Asset Management Lifecycle\nProcurement – Acquiring new software from software vendors and managing software licenses.\nInstallation – Deploying new software products to employee assets, to include phones, tablets, desktops, servers, and cloud infrastructure.\nDiscovery – The identification of software by actively searching systems connected to the enterprise network.\nUsage – The authorized use of approved software by employees .\nUpdate and Upgrade – Applying minor software patches or replacing a software asset with new functionality.\nRemoval – Deleting or retiring software from enterprise assets.\nProcurement\nThe procurement process generally consists of purchasing new software from external vendors, including from managed service providers (MSPs) and cloud service providers (CSPs), or obtaining new software by transfer from another business unit within the same enterprise. Those individuals charged with making purchasing decisions, often from the IT or financial business units, should evaluate all vendors before making a purchase. There should be a pre-defined process in place to ensure the vendor is reputable and that major components are not left out of any contracts.\nCIS provides a simple template for starting an software asset inventory, but many enterprises will quickly find the need to move to something more robust, such as a third-party tool or database. Note that the software asset inventory is likely to contain sensitive information that could be leveraged by malicious parties. Therefore, the inventory should have sufficient access control to prevent unauthorized access and modification.\nInstallation\nThe installation process generally consists of deploying new services or additional software required for business functions to employee assets, including laptops, desktops, phones, tablets, servers, and cloud infrastructure. This process varies for each software and the device on which it is installed. However, in general it requires code to be copied to local folders on the asset to facilitate access by the operating system. Installation includes the creation of necessary directories and registering environment variables. During this process, IT would ensure the software is configured appropriately, not only for execution but also security purposes.\nDiscovery\nOnce software applications are installed on enterprise assets, the maintenance process begins. Part of this maintenance process consists of searching for new software on your enterprise assets through the use of freely or commercially available discovery tools. Any new software identified should be added to the software asset inventory.\nOnce the inventory is updated, either via discovery or other means, it is time to check all discovered software against the known list of approved software. This may take some time, but it is critical from a cybersecurity perspective. Any unauthorized software must be investigated to understand if this is new software that needs to be added to the approved inventory listing or if the software is unauthorized and needs to be removed. Some software may be malicious in nature and must be removed. If a software is deemed to be malicious, it may be pertinent to activate the enterprise’s incident response process.\nUsage\nTh is phase is the step with the least amount of interaction with IT and cybersecurity, as users are simply using the software they were provisioned with to accomplish their everyday work tasks. A set of rules governing how a user can leverage software to perform their job should be in place and properly communicated to the user . Accordingly, the usage phase of this document contains a sample set of policy statements. It is commonplace for these rules to be placed within a separate policy document called an Acceptable Use Policy . The owner of this Software Asset Management Policy may choose to delete all content in the usage section and refer to an external Acceptable Use Policy that may already be in place. Note that the statements contained within the Usage phase of this document are insufficient to act as a fully realized Acceptable Use Policy .\nUpdate & Upgrade\nThe u pgrade process for software entails replacing the software asset with a newer version provided by the developer . Newer versions of software are usually accompanied by major changes or security enhancements, an d often drastically change the application, operating system, or software. The update process is the act of modifying already installed software, which consists of patches and ad hoc updates that do not consist of major changes to the software. Some enterprises may wish to test updates before they are integrated into production environments. Updates are part of a regular operational process whereas upgrades occur when the enterprise requires additional features or otherwise retire the existing version. This means that software updates occur more frequently than software upgrades, and upgrades may never occur depending on budget or the developer. For additional information please refer to the Vulnerability Management Policy Template .\nRemoval\nSoftware removal refers to the process of uninstalling software from an enterprise asset or enterprise environment . Removal may be necessary due to various reasons such as the software is now deemed unauthorized or is no longer necessary for the enterpris e’ s business functions or mission. Additionally, contract s with vendor s may have end ed , or software may simply have been superseded by another application. It’s often common to remove software and data from assets when sending a device back for warranty or repair. Removal can be completed manually or with the assistance of tooling. It is important to remember that components of the software may be located in different directories and folders.\nLicense Management\nAll software has a license associated with it. This may be a commercial, open source or an implicit free license. A software license states what can and cannot be done with the software, under what conditions it can be used or modified , for how long, any bounds surrounding distributing the software to others, and potentially more. Abiding to each license is best practice and often the law. Tracking user licenses , maintaining registration fees, complying with licensing terms, and most importantly, determining relevance for each license is a necessity . Most enterprises have a wide range of software and licenses in use every day . A license management system allows enterprises to have a clear view and understanding of the licenses and entitlements that they own , and how they are being used within the ir environment .\nSoftware Asset Management Policy Template\nPurpose\nSoftware asset management is the process of procuring, identifying, tracking, maintaining, and removing software on enterprise assets. Th is Software Asset Management Policy provides the policies for governing the software asset lifecycle while an enterprise is using a software asset . A software inventory must be created and maintained to support the enterprise’s mission and to help ensure only authorized software is installed and used. This software inventory must be up-to-date and reflect the current state of software across the enterprise .\nResponsibility\nThe IT business unit is responsible for all software asset management functions. This information is relayed to other business units within the enterprise such as finance, accounting, and cybersecurity as needed. IT is responsible for informing all users of their responsibilities in the use of any assets assigned to them.",
        "exceptions": "Exceptions to this policy are likely to occur. Requests for e xception must be made in writing and must contain:\nThe reason for the request,\nRisk to the enterprise of not following the written policy,\nSpecific mitigations that will not be implemented,\nTechnical and other difficulties, and\nDate of review.",

        "safeguards": "I. Introduction.\nYourCompanyName is committed to full compliance with applicable laws related to the use of artificial intelligence in the countries in which YourCompanyName provides products and services. Additionally, YourCompanyName is committed to the ethical use of artificial intelligence. This Artificial Intelligence Use Policy (“Policy”) outlines YourCompanyName ’s requirements with respect to the adoption of all forms of artificial intelligence at YourCompanyName . Such artificial intelligence adoption includes use for business efficiencies, operations, and inclusion in YourCompanyName ’s products and services.\nThis Policy is applicable to all YourCompanyName directors, officers, board members, employees, contractors, representatives, affiliates, agents, and any person or entity performing services for or on behalf of YourCompanyName. The ResponsibleCorporateOfficer at YourCompanyName is responsible for the enforcement of this Policy.\nII. Definitions.\n“Artificial intelligence” or “AI” means the use of machine learning technology, software, automation, and algorithms to perform tasks and make rules or predictions based on existing datasets and instructions.\n“Artificial Intelligence Committee” or “AI Committee” is an internal YourCompanyName committee tasked with reviewing and approving uses of AI at YourCompanyName.\n“Artificial intelligence system” or “AI system” means software that is developed with one or more of the techniques and approaches listed in Annex I and can, for a given set of human-defined objectives, generate outputs such as content, predictions, recommendations, or decisions influencing the environments they interact with.\n“Closed AI system” means an AI system where the input provided by one user is used to train the AI model. Input data from the user is isolated from other users, and the data is considered more secure.\n“Embedded AI Tools” means AI tools embedded in existing software tools approved and used at YourCompanyName and which do not require approval for use from the AI Committee.\n“Government” means the government of a country or subdivision thereof.\n“Government Entity” means any entity controlled by a government in whole or part. This includes Government-owned or controlled (whether whole or partial ownership or control) commercial enterprises, institutions, agencies, departments, instrumentalities, and other public entities, including research institutions and universities.\n“Government Official” means any officer or employee of a Government Entity, an official of a political party, a candidate for political office, officers and employees of non-governmental international organizations, and any person with responsibility to allocate or influence expenditures of Government funds. This includes data scientists and researchers who are employed by a government or a Government Entity. Employees at government organizations are considered Government Officials regardless of title or position.\n“Non-public YourCompanyName data” means any information that, if disclosed, could violate the privacy of individuals, government regulations or statutes, could jeopardize the financial state of YourCompanyName , could injure its reputation, or could reduce its competitive advantage.\n“Open AI system” means an AI system where the input provided by all users is used to train the AI model. Input data from all users is not private and may be revealed to other users.\n“Personal information” means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular person or household.\n“ YourCompanyName Representatives” means all YourCompanyName directors, officers, board members, employees, contractors, representatives, resellers and sub- resellers, distributors and sub-distributors, affiliates, agents, and any person or entity performing services for or on behalf of YourCompanyName .\nIII. Guiding Principles.\nThe intent of this Policy is to provide general guidance on the use of AI at YourCompanyName so that YourCompanyName can leverage the use of AI as a tool while ensuring it continues to meet legal obligations and act in an ethical manner. The use of AI at YourCompanyName should never compromise Y ourCompanyName ’s core values or introduce undue risk to the organization. Rather, the use of AI at YourCompanyName should be focused on improving business efficiencies and enhancing YourCompanyName’ s ability to fulfill its mission.\nIt is important to remember that the YourCompanyName is a global organization. The YourCompanyName has entities and staff globally and provides its products and services to customers globally as well. Accordingly, this Policy provides overarching guidance based on global standards for the use of AI. YourCompanyName Representatives should be cognizant when using AI at YourCompanyName that they think about the global impact of their decision to use AI, as the use of AI in some countries may not be permitted in others.\nThis Policy is not intended to address every use of AI at YourCompanyName by a YourCompanyName Representative. There are certain business departments and functions at YourCompanyName that bear more considerations and potential risks. Before using any AI at YourCompanyName —whether for personal business tasks such as writing an email or more complex business processes such as analyzing datasets - you should consult with your manager and seek guidance. Also, please see Prohibited Uses in Section IV below for situations in which AI may not be used at YourCompanyName , and High-Risk Use of AI Systems in Section VI below for situations in which extreme caution is required when considering using AI.\nIn addition, there are certain Embedded AI Tools used in existing approved YourCompanyName software that do not require additional approval for use. For example, the use of Microsoft Word in which Microsoft Word has embedded an AI tool to check spelling or grammar. The use of Embedded AI Tools in approved software at YourCompanyName is permitted, provided those software tools are aligned with previous general business uses. A list of existing software tools with Embedded AI Tools that are approved at YourCompanyName can be found here [ INSERT LINK ].\nWhen third-party software, services, or contractors are utilized or employed, any AI usage by software used by these parties or services must be noted and evaluated carefully. Contracted services that utilize AI technology should be considered in the same light as individual AI usage. Consult with the Legal Department about the inclusion of an AI-specific clause in any vendor or contractor agreements.\nThe following principles must be followed when considering using an AI system at YourCompanyName :\nThe use of an AI system should primarily focus on completing departmental goals as directed by company leadership. Except for the use of an Embedded AI Tool in a software system approved for use at YourCompanyName , any use of a new AI System at YourCompanyName must be approved by the AI Committee. Please see the Standard Operating Procedure here [ INSERT LINK ] for the process for getting an AI system approved. Also, see General AI Use Standards and Use Approval in Section IV below.\nIndividuals using an AI system must have expertise in the subject matter for which the AI is used. AI is to be utilized as a tool and is not a substitute for expertise. For example, if using AI for coding, the individual deploying the AI must have expertise in coding.\nAll AI-generated content (writing, datasets, graphs, pictures, etc.) must be thoroughly reviewed by an individual with expertise to evaluate such content for accuracy as well as general proofing and editing. AI-generated content should be viewed as a starting point, not the finished product. Like any content at YourCompanyName , AI-generated content should conform to the look and feel of the YourCompanyName brand and voice.\nAny use of an AI system must have clear objectives for the AI use as a tool and business-accepted data sets from which the AI draws. If the data sets that the AI is using are not accurate, then the information AI provides will not be accurate.\nAI systems are trained on data that may contain inherent bias. Users of these systems are responsible for reviewing any AI-produced content for bias and correcting it as necessary.\nNon-public YourCompanyName information must never be put into an open AI system.\nYourCompanyName Representatives must document all AI systems they are utilizing and for what functions. Tracking the use of AI is not optional and is part of your job. Documentation of specific AI Embedded Tools in an approved existing software tool when using that tool as intended is not required. Discuss the process for tracking the use of AI systems with your department head.\nThe use of an AI system must be documented to capture institutional knowledge. For example, if AI is used to create code and included in a larger section of code, there must be documentation as to which code section is AI-derived and who reviewed it.\nThe use of an AI system must meet any terms of use or contractual limitations. Contractual restrictions or terms of use may restrict YourCompanyName ’s use of an AI system that would otherwise be legally compliant and ethically sound. For example, an AI system’s terms of use may require the use of certain disclaimers in certain use situations or prohibit the use of the AI system to do certain tasks. YourCompanyName Representatives should have all terms or use or contracts for AI systems reviewed by the Legal Department to ensure compliance with contractual obligations in using an AI system.\nApproval of an AI system does not eliminate the need for other internal approvals required at YourCompanyName for the use of technology, such as a security review, privacy review, cost review and spend approval, legal review, human resources review, etc. An AI system should go through the same review and approval process as other software or services at YourCompanyName . You should also ensure within your business unit that your business leader is aware of the use of the AI system and has approved any use of the AI system, particularly for AI-generated content that will be relayed externally.\nIV. Prohibited Uses.\nThere are certain uses of AI that are prohibited. Unless otherwise approved by the AI committee and respective department heads, YourCompanyName Representatives are prohibited from using AI systems for any of the following activities at any time:\nConducting political lobbying activities is prohibited. Lobbying is defined as any action aimed at influencing a Government, Government Official, or Government Entity for any reason.\nUsing AI systems to identify or categorize students, candidates, employees, contractors, or other affiliated entities based on protected class status is prohibited.\nEntering trade secrets, confidential information, or personal data about any individual into an open AI system.\nEntering any sensitive information about an individual into any AI system. “Sensitive information” includes medical, financial, political affiliation, racial or ethnic origin, religious beliefs, gender, sexual orientation, disability status, or any other part of a person’s life someone would want to keep private.\nUsing an AI system to obtain legal advice, including, but not limited to, creating policies for internal use or to provide to third parties.\nCreating intellectual property that YourCompanyName desires to register and/or holds significant value to the organization.\nV. Ethical Guidelines.\nYourCompanyName desires to act in an ethical manner when using AI. Accordingly, there may be uses of AI that are legally permissible but which do not meet ethical requirements. Any use of an AI system at YourCompanyName should conform to the following ethical guidelines:\nInformed Consent: Prior to inputting personal information into a closed AI system, ensure that you have obtained informed consent from the individual(s) whose personal information will be inputted.\nIntegrity in Use : All users of AI systems should be honest about how AI helped in getting the work done. Even if using an AI system approved by the AI Committee for an approved use, you should ensure your manager or the department requesting a task for which you are using an AI system is aware of your use of the AI system. Do not pass off AI-generated work as done by you solely. Additionally, you should ask permission if you desire to use an AI system tool to complete a task. For example, you should ask your manager and HR representative if you may use an AI system to assist in writing a performance evaluation.\nAppropriate Content : Do not use company time or resources to generate content using an AI system that would be considered illegal, inappropriate, harmful to YourCompanyName’s brand or reputation, or disrespectful to others.\nUnauthorized Use: Do not use company time or resources to generate content using an AI system for personal use without prior approval of the appropriate department leader.\nVI. High-Risk Use of AI Systems.\nThere are certain uses of AI systems that are more high risk than others. As a global company, YourCompanyName is committed to complying with all AI legal requirements and guidance in the countries in which it operates. The European Union (“EU”) has classified the following potential uses of AI as posing a high risk to the health and safety or fundamental rights of natural persons. Therefore, there are several additional requirements for the use of AI systems in such cases. These requirements are listed in Appendix II, with certain functions highlighted below:\nPersonal Data in AI Systems: AI should be used with extreme caution when inputting any personal data of an individual into a closed AI system (it is prohibited to put any personal data into an open AI system).\nScreening Job Candidates: AI should be used with caution when screening any job applicants to ensure it does not adversely impact protected class members or introduce any bias. Equity and inclusion issues surrounding AI use in job screening are a potential source of litigation.\nPersonnel Decisions: AI should be used with caution for any use related to making decisions on promotions, retention, or similar personnel such decisions. Extreme caution should be utilized to ensure that biases (including biases found in existing data sets) are avoided.\nEnrollment Decisions: Extreme caution should be utilized if using AI in any manner related to evaluating potential candidates for admission into a university, academy, internship or apprenticeship program, or any other YourCompanyName program.\nAssessment of Students: Any assessment of students in educational or vocational training institutions is considered high risk. Accordingly, extreme caution should be utilized before using any AI system intended to assess or evaluate any student participating in a course, taking an exam, or other evaluation or assessment.\nGeneral AI System Use Standards and Use Approval\nExcept for AI Embedded Tools in approved software, all uses of AI systems must be approved by the AI Committee prior to use to ensure such AI system use meets the following principles:\nLawful: The use of AI systems must comply with all applicable laws and regulations, as well as any contractual obligations, limitations, or restrictions.\nEthical: The use of AI systems must adhere to ethical principles, be fair, and avoid bias.\nTransparent: There must be clear objectives for the use of an AI system and documented oversight of such use, which is recorded and captured for institutional knowledge. Disclosures of the use of AI in any AI-assisted content generation must be made when required by law or contract, or when required by the YourCompanyName .\nNecessary: The use of AI systems must be for a valid business purpose to improve YourCompanyName ’s business efficiencies and support the organization’s mission. The use of AI is not a substitute for human critical thinking or expertise and should not require YourCompanyName to incur an unnecessary expense without any true benefit.\nPrior to submitting a request to the AI Committee for the use of an AI system, a requester should first obtain the approval of his or her manager. In addition, in evaluating whether to make a request, the requester should ensure that the AI system use, if approved, would conform with the guidelines in this Policy, prior to submitting such request. Requests for the use of an AI system should follow the SOP here [ INSERT LINK ].\nTraining\nAll YourCompanyName Representatives who interact with AI systems must be trained on this Policy. Additionally, specific departments or functions at YourCompanyName may require more specific training on the use of AI systems for their department or function when more high-risk.\nIX. Reporting Non-Compliance.\nYourCompanyName directors, managers, employees, and agents aware of any conduct that may violate this Policy have a responsibility to report it. Individuals are encouraged to make reports through normal reporting relationships beginning with their manager. All reports of suspected misconduct or non-compliance will be investigated by the AI Committee, Legal Counsel, Human Resources, or other appropriate parties. Unless acting in bad faith, YourCompanyName employees will not be subject to reprisals for reporting potential violations.\nIf YourCompanyName determines that a YourCompanyName Representative has failed to comply with this Policy after an investigation concludes, then the YourCompanyName Representative will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.\nANNEX I\nAI TECHNIQUES AND APPROACHES\nMachine learning approaches, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, using a wide variety of methods, including deep learning.\nLogic and knowledge-based approaches, including knowledge representation, inductive (logic) programming, knowledge bases, inference, deductive engines, (symbolic) reasoning, and expert systems.\nStatistical approaches, Bayesian estimation, search, and optimization methods.\nANNEX II\nEU High-Risk System Requirements\nRequirements should apply to high-risk AI systems as regards the quality of data sets used, technical documentation and record-keeping, transparency, the provision of information to users, human oversight, robustness, accuracy, and cybersecurity. Those requirements are necessary to effectively mitigate the risks for health, safety, and fundamental rights, as applicable in the light of the intended purpose of the system, and no other less trade-restrictive measures are available, thus avoiding unjustified restrictions to trade.\nHigh data quality is essential for the performance of many AI systems, especially when techniques involving the training of models are used, with a view to ensure that the high-risk AI system performs as intended and safely, and it does not become the source of discrimination prohibited by Union law. High-quality training, validation, and testing data sets require the implementation of appropriate data governance and management practices. Training, validation, and testing data sets should be relevant, representative, free of errors, and complete in view of the system's intended purpose. They should also have the appropriate statistical properties, including as regards the persons or groups of persons on which the high-risk AI system is intended to be used. Training, validation, and testing data sets should consider, to the extent required in the light of their intended purpose, the features, characteristics, or elements that are particular to the specific geographical, behavioral, or functional setting or context within which the AI system is intended to be used. To protect the rights of others from the discrimination that might result from the bias in AI systems, the providers should be able to process also special categories of personal data, as a matter of substantial public interest, to ensure the bias monitoring, detection, and correction in relation to high-risk AI systems.\nFor the development of high-risk AI systems, certain actors, such as providers, notified bodies, and other relevant entities, such as digital innovation hubs, testing experimentation facilities, and researchers, should be able to access and use high-quality datasets within their respective fields of activities which are related to this Regulation. European common data spaces established by the Commission and the facilitation of data sharing between businesses and with the government in the public interest will be instrumental in providing trustful, accountable, and non-discriminatory access to high- quality data for the training, validation, and testing of AI systems. For example, in health, the European health data space will facilitate non-discriminatory access to health data and the training of artificial intelligence algorithms on those datasets, in a privacy-preserving, secure, timely, transparent, and trustworthy manner, and with appropriate institutional governance. Relevant competent authorities, including sectoral ones, providing, or supporting the access to data may also support the provision of high-quality data for the training, validation and testing of AI systems.\nHaving information on how high-risk AI systems have been developed and how they perform throughout their lifecycle is essential to verify compliance with the requirements under this Regulation. This requires keeping records and technical documentation, containing information necessary to assess the AI system's compliance with the relevant requirements. Such information should include the typical characteristics, capabilities and limitations of the system, algorithms, data, training, testing, and validation processes used, as well as documentation on the relevant risk management system. The technical documentation should be kept up to date.\nTo address the opacity that may make certain AI systems incomprehensible or too complex for natural persons, a certain degree of transparency should be required for high-risk AI systems. Users should be able to interpret the system output and use it appropriately. High-risk AI systems should, therefore, be accompanied by relevant documentation and instructions of use and include concise and clear information, including in relation to risks to fundamental rights and discrimination, where appropriate.\nHigh-risk AI systems should be designed and developed in such a way that natural persons can oversee their functioning. For this purpose, appropriate human oversight measures should be identified by the provider of the system before it is placed on the market or put into service. Where appropriate, such measures should guarantee that the system is subject to in-built operational constraints that cannot be overridden by the system itself and is responsive to the human operator, and that the natural persons to whom human oversight has been assigned have the necessary competence, training, and authority to carry out that role.\nHigh-risk AI systems should perform consistently throughout their lifecycle and meet an appropriate level of accuracy, robustness, and cybersecurity in accordance with the acknowledged state of the art. The level of accuracy and accuracy metrics should be communicated to the users.\nTechnical robustness is a key requirement for high-risk AI systems. They should be resilient against risks connected to the limitations of the system (e.g., errors, faults, inconsistencies, unexpected situations) as well as against malicious actions that may compromise the security of the AI system and result in harmful or otherwise undesirable behavior. Failure to protect against these risks could lead to safety impacts or negatively affect fundamental rights, for example, due to erroneous decisions or wrong or biased outputs generated by the AI system.\nCybersecurity plays a crucial role in ensuring that AI systems are resilient against attempts to alter their use, behavior, and performance or compromise their security properties by malicious third parties exploiting the system’s vulnerabilities. Cyberattacks against AI systems can leverage AI-specific assets, such as training data sets (e.g., data poisoning) or trained models (e.g., adversarial attacks), or exploit vulnerabilities in the AI system’s digital assets or the underlying ICT infrastructure. To ensure a level of cybersecurity appropriate to the risks, suitable measures should therefore be taken by the providers of high-risk AI systems, also considering as appropriate the underlying ICT infrastructure.\nSource: EU Artificial Intelligence Act, para. 43-51\nANNEX III\nPotentially Applicable EU High-Risk System Types\n‘Real-time’ and ‘post’ remote biometric identification systems. Both types should be subject to specific requirements on logging capabilities and human oversight.\nAI systems used in education or vocational training, notably for determining access or assigning persons to educational and vocational training institutions or to evaluate persons on tests as part of or as a precondition for their education.\nAI systems used in employment, workers management, and access to self-employment, notably for the recruitment and selection of persons, for making decisions on promotion and termination, and for task allocation, monitoring, or evaluation of persons in work-related contractual relationships.\nAccess to and enjoyment of certain essential private and public services and benefits necessary for people to fully participate in society or to improve one’s standard of living. AI systems are used to evaluate the credit score or creditworthiness of natural persons.\nSource: EU Artificial Intelligence Act, para. 33-37"

        "safeguards": "General\nIn order to maintain the security of <Company Name>'s internal databases, access by software programs must be granted only after authentication with credentials. The credentials used for this authentication must not reside in the main, executing body of the program's source code in clear text or easily reversible encryption. Database credentials must not be stored in a location that can be accessed through a web server. Algorithms in use must meet the standards defined for use in NIST publication FIPS 140-2 or any superseding document, according to date of implementation. The use of the RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) algorithms is strongly recommended for asymmetric encryption.\nSpecific Requirements\nStorage of Data Base Usernames and Passwords\nDatabase usernames and passwords may be stored in a file separate from the executing body of the program's code. This file must not be world readable or writeable.\nDatabase credentials may reside on the database server. In this case, a hash function number identifying the credentials may be stored in the executing body of the program's code.\nDatabase credentials may be stored as part of an authentication server (i.e., an entitlement directory), such as an LDAP server used for user authentication. Database authentication may occur on behalf of a program as part of the user authentication process at the authentication server. In this case, there is no need for programmatic use of database credentials.\nDatabase credentials may not reside in the documents tree of a web server.\nPasswords or pass phrases used to access a database must adhere to the Password Policy.\nRetrieval of Database User Names and Passwords\nIf stored in a file that is not source code, then database user names and passwords must be read from the file immediately prior to use. Immediately following database authentication, the memory containing the user name and password must be released or cleared.\nThe scope into which you may store database credentials must be physically separated from the other areas of your code, e.g., the credentials must be in a separate source file. The file that contains the credentials must contain no other code but the credentials (i.e., the user name and password) and any functions, routines, or methods that will be used to access the credentials.\nFor languages that execute from source code, the credentials' source file must not reside in the same browsable or executable file directory tree in which the executing body of code resides.\nAccess to Database Usernames and Passwords\nEvery program or every collection of programs implementing a single business function must have unique database credentials. Sharing of credentials between programs is not allowed.\nDatabase passwords used by programs are system-level passwords as defined by the Password Policy.\nDeveloper groups must have a process in place to ensure that database passwords are controlled and changed in accordance with the Password Policy. This process must include a method for restricting knowledge of database passwords to a need-to-know basis.\nUsers and/or software accessing sensitive data must be subjected to proper access control and should not be able to perform privileged operations that are out of scope of said user and/or software.\nCoding Techniques for Implementing this Policy\n[Add references to your site-specific guidelines for the different coding languages such as Perl, JAVA, C and/or Cpro .]"

Users not complying with these policies could be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination.\nPolicy awareness and acknowledgment, by signing the acknowledgment form, is required before access will be granted.\nApproval\nInternet access is requested by the user or user’s manager submitting an IT Access Request form to the IT department along with an attached copy of a signed Internet usage Coverage Acknowledgment Form.\nRemoval of privileges\nInternet access will be discontinued upon termination of employee, completion of contract, end of service of non-employee, or disciplinary action arising from violation of this policy. In the case of a change in job function and/or transfer the original access code will be discontinued, and only reissued if necessary and a new request for access is approved. All user IDs that have been inactive for thirty (30) days will be revoked. The privileges granted to users must be reevaluated by management annually. In response to feedback from management, systems administrators must promptly revoke all privileges no longer needed by users.\nResource Usage Access to the Internet will be approved and provided only if reasonable business needs are identified. Internet services will be granted based on an employee’s current job responsibilities. If an employee moves to another business unit or changes job functions, a new Internet access request must be submitted within 5 days. User Internet access requirements will be reviewed periodically by company departments to ensure that continuing needs exist.\nAllowed Usage\nInternet usage is granted for the sole purpose of supporting business activities necessary to carry out job functions. All users must follow the corporate principles regarding resource usage and exercise good judgment in using the Internet. Questions can be addressed to the IT Department.\nAcceptable use of the Internet for performing job functions might include:\nCommunication between employees and non-employees for business purposes;\nIT technical support downloading software upgrades and patches;\nReview of possible vendor web sites for product information;\nReference regulatory or technical information.\nResearch\nPersonal Usage\nUsing company computer resources to access the Internet for personal purposes, without approval from the user’s manager and the IT department, may be considered cause for disciplinary action up to and including termination. All users of the Internet should be aware that the company network creates an audit log reflecting request for service, both in-bound and out-bound addresses, and is periodically reviewed.\nUsers who choose to store or transmit personal information such as private keys, credit card numbers or certificates or make use of Internet \"wallets\" do so at their own risk. The company is not responsible for any loss of information, such as information stored in the wallet, or any consequential loss of personal property\nProhibited Usage\nInformation stored in the wallet, or any consequential loss of personal property.\nAcquisition, storage, and dissemination of data which is illegal, pornographic, or which negatively depicts race, sex or creed is specifically prohibited .\nThe company also prohibits the conduct of a business enterprise, political activity, engaging in any form of intelligence collection from our facilities, engaging in fraudulent activities, or knowingly disseminating false or otherwise libelous materials.\nOther activities that are strictly prohibited include, but are not limited to:\nAccessing company information that is not within the scope of one’s work. This includes unauthorized reading of customer account information, unauthorized access of personnel file information, and accessing information that is not needed for the proper execution of job functions.\nMisusing, disclosing without proper authorization, or altering customer or personnel information. This includes making unauthorized changes to a personnel file or sharing electronic customer or personnel data with unauthorized personnel.\nDeliberate pointing or hyper-linking of company Web sites to other Internet/WWW sites whose content may be inconsistent with or in violation of the aims or policies of the company.\nAny conduct that would constitute or encourage a criminal offense, lead to civil liability, or otherwise violate any regulations, local, state, national or international law including without limitations US export control laws and regulations.\nUse, transmission, duplication, or voluntary receipt of material that infringes on the copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, or patent rights of any person or organization. Assume that all materials on the Internet are copyright and/or patented unless specific notices state otherwise.\nTransmission of any proprietary, confidential, or otherwise sensitive information without the proper controls.\nCreation, posting, transmission, or voluntary receipt of any unlawful, offensive, libelous, threatening, harassing material, including but not limited to comments based on race, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, or political beliefs.\nAny form of gambling.\nUnless specifically authorized under the provisions of section 4.3, the following activities are also strictly prohibited:\nUnauthorized downloading of any shareware programs or files for use without authorization in advance from the IT Department and the user’s manager.\nAny ordering (shopping) of items or services on the Internet.\nPlaying of any games.\nForwarding of chain letters.\nParticipation in any on-line contest or promotion.\nAcceptance of promotional gifts.\nBandwidth both within the company and in connecting to the Internet is a shared, finite resource. Users must make reasonable efforts to use this resource in ways that do not negatively affect other employees. Specific departments may set guidelines on bandwidth use and resource allocation, and may ban the downloading of particular file types.\nSoftware License\nThe company strongly supports strict adherence to software vendors’ license agreements. When at work, or when company computing or networking resources are employed, copying of software in a manner not consistent with the vendor’s license is strictly forbidden. Questions regarding lawful versus unlawful copying should be referred to the IT Department for review or to request a ruling from the Legal Department before any copying is done.\nSimilarly, reproduction of materials available over the Internet must be done only with the written permission of the author or owner of the document. Unless permission from the copyright owner(s) is first obtained, making copies of material from magazines, journals, newsletters, other publications and online documents is forbidden unless this is both reasonable and customary. This notion of \"fair use\" is in keeping with international copyright laws.\nUsing company computer resources to access the Internet for personal purposes, without approval from the user’s manager and the IT department, may be considered cause for disciplinary action up to and including termination. All users of the Internet should be aware that the company network creates an audit log reflecting request for service, both in-bound and out-bound addresses, and is periodically reviewed.\nUsers who choose to store or transmit personal information such as private keys, credit card numbers or certificates or make use of Internet \"wallets\" do so at their own risk.\nReview of Public Information\nAll publicly-writeable directories on Internet-connected computers will be reviewed and cleared each evening. This process is necessary to prevent the anonymous exchange of information inconsistent with company business. Examples of unauthorized public information include pirated information, passwords, credit card numbers, and pornography.\nExpectation of Privacy\nMonitoring\nUsers should consider their Internet activities as periodically monitored and limit their activities accordingly. Management reserves the right to examine E-mail, personal file directories, web access, and other information stored on company computers, at any time and without notice. This examination ensures compliance with internal policies and assists with the management of company information systems.\nE-mail Confidentiality\nUsers should be aware that clear text E-mail is not a confidential means of communication. The company cannot guarantee that electronic communications will be private. Employees should be aware that electronic communications can, depending on the technology, be forwarded, intercepted, printed, and stored by others. Users should also be aware that once an E-mail is transmitted it may be altered. Deleting an E-mail from an individual workstation will not eliminate it from the various systems across which it has been transmitted.\nMaintaining Corporate Image\nRepresentation\nWhen using company resources to access and use the Internet, users must realize they represent the company. Whenever employees state an affiliation to the company, they must also clearly indicate that \"the opinions expressed are my own and not necessarily those of the company\". Questions may be addressed to the IT Department.\nCompany Materials\nUsers must not place company material (examples: internal memos, press releases, product or usage information, documentation, etc.) on any mailing list, public news group, or such service. Any posting of materials must be approved by the employee’s manager and the public relations department and will be placed by an authorized individual.\nCreating Web Sites\nAll individuals and/or business units wishing to establish a WWW home page or site must first develop business, implementation, and maintenance plans. Formal authorization must be obtained through the IT Department. This will maintain publishing and content standards needed to ensure consistency and appropriateness.\nIn addition, contents of the material made available to the public through the Internet must be formally reviewed and approved before being published. All material should be submitted to the Corporate Communications Directors for initial approval to continue. All company pages are owned by, and are the ultimate responsibility of, the Corporate Communications Directors. All company web sites must be protected from unwanted intrusion through formal security measures which can be obtained from the IT department."
