## Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to establish requirements for data backup and recovery processes to ensure Guatemaltek can restore critical business operations following data loss, system failure, disaster, or security incident. Proper data recovery capabilities are essential for business continuity and resilience.

## Scope

This policy applies to:
- All Guatemaltek information systems and data
- All employees, contractors, and third parties managing Guatemaltek systems
- All backup and recovery processes
- All data storage locations (on-premises and cloud)
- All disaster recovery and business continuity procedures

## Policy

### Backup Requirements

#### 1. Backup Scope

All Guatemaltek systems and data must be backed up according to their criticality:

**Critical Systems** (Recovery Time Objective: 4 hours):
- Email systems
- Customer databases
- Financial systems
- Authentication systems
- Production applications

**Important Systems** (Recovery Time Objective: 24 hours):
- File servers
- Internal applications
- Development environments
- Collaboration platforms

**Standard Systems** (Recovery Time Objective: 72 hours):
- Archive data
- Historical records
- Non-production systems

#### 2. Backup Frequency

| System Type | Full Backup | Incremental | Differential |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Critical** | Weekly | Daily | N/A |
| **Important** | Weekly | Daily | N/A |
| **Standard** | Monthly | Weekly | N/A |

**Additional Requirements:**
- Database transaction logs: Continuous or every 15 minutes
- Email: Continuous or hourly
- Critical files: Real-time replication where possible

#### 3. Backup Retention

**Short-term Retention:**
- Daily backups: 30 days
- Weekly backups: 90 days
- Monthly backups: 1 year

**Long-term Retention:**
- Annual backups: 7 years (or per regulatory requirements)
- Critical business records: Per legal/compliance requirements
- Financial data: Minimum 7 years

#### 4. Backup Storage Locations

**3-2-1 Backup Rule:**
- **3** copies of data (1 primary + 2 backups)
- **2** different storage media types
- **1** off-site backup copy

**Storage Requirements:**
- Primary backup: On-site encrypted storage
- Secondary backup: Off-site or cloud storage (geographically separated)
- Backups encrypted at rest
- Access controls applied to all backup storage

### Data Protection

#### 1. Encryption

- All backups must be encrypted using approved encryption standards
- Encryption keys managed separately from backup data
- Key management follows Guatemaltek's encryption policy

#### 2. Access Control

- Access to backups limited to authorized personnel
- Multi-factor authentication required for backup system access
- All access logged and reviewed monthly
- Separate accounts for backup administration

#### 3. Testing and Validation

**Backup Verification:**
- Automated verification after each backup
- Check for completion, integrity, and errors
- Alert on backup failures

**Restore Testing:**
- Critical systems: Quarterly full restore test
- Important systems: Semi-annual restore test
- Standard systems: Annual restore test
- Document test results and remediate issues

### Recovery Procedures

#### 1. Recovery Time Objectives (RTO)

| System Criticality | RTO Target | Maximum Downtime |
|-------------------|-----------|------------------|
| Critical | 4 hours | 8 hours |
| Important | 24 hours | 48 hours |
| Standard | 72 hours | 1 week |

#### 2. Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)

| System Criticality | RPO Target | Maximum Data Loss |
|-------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Critical | 1 hour | 4 hours |
| Important | 24 hours | 48 hours |
| Standard | 1 week | 2 weeks |

#### 3. Recovery Process

**Step 1: Incident Assessment**
- Determine cause of data loss
- Assess scope and impact
- Identify recovery requirements
- Notify CISO and management

**Step 2: Recovery Plan Activation**
- Activate appropriate recovery team
- Communicate with stakeholders
- Establish recovery timeline
- Document recovery process

**Step 3: Data Restoration**
- Identify most recent viable backup
- Verify backup integrity
- Restore to production or alternate environment
- Validate restored data

**Step 4: System Validation**
- Test system functionality
- Verify data integrity and completeness
- Confirm business process operation
- User acceptance testing

**Step 5: Return to Normal Operations**
- Transition to restored systems
- Monitor for issues
- Document lessons learned
- Update recovery procedures as needed

### Disaster Recovery Integration

1. **Disaster Recovery Plan**: This policy supports Guatemaltek's Disaster Recovery Plan (when established)

2. **Business Continuity**: Recovery procedures align with business continuity requirements

3. **Alternative Sites**: Critical systems have alternate recovery locations identified

4. **Communication**: Recovery procedures include stakeholder communication plans

### Cloud and Third-Party Services

1. **Cloud Backups**:
   - Use approved cloud providers
   - Verify provider backup/recovery capabilities
   - Understand provider responsibilities vs. Guatemaltek responsibilities
   - Test cloud recovery procedures

2. **SaaS Applications**:
   - Verify vendor backup policies
   - Consider third-party backup solutions
   - Export critical data regularly
