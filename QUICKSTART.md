## First Use (2 minutes)

### Test the Skill

In Claude Code, try:

```
"Can you audit my application for GDPR compliance?"
```

You should see:
```
The "gdpr-auditor" skill is running
```

### Run Your First Audit

```
"Audit the codebase at /path/to/my/project for GDPR compliance"
```

Claude will:
1. Load GDPR auditor skill
2. Analyze your code structure
3. Scan for personal data patterns
4. Check compliance against GDPR articles
5. Generate a detailed audit report

### Example Output

```markdown
# GDPR Compliance Audit Report

## Executive Summary
- Overall Status: PARTIALLY COMPLIANT
- Critical Issues: 3
- High Priority: 5
- Risk Level: HIGH

## Critical Issues

1. Missing Privacy Policy
   - GDPR Articles: 12, 13, 14
   - Code Reference: None found
   - Recommendation: Create comprehensive privacy policy...

[... detailed findings with specific code references ...]
```

## Common Use Cases

### Audit a Web Application

```
"Analyze my FastAPI application at /path/to/app for GDPR compliance,
focusing on user data handling and security measures"
```

### Check Specific Compliance Area

```
"Check if my application implements all data subject rights required by GDPR"
```

### Review Database Schema

```
"Analyze this database schema for GDPR compliance:
[paste schema]"
```

### Evaluate Privacy Policy

```
"Review this privacy policy against GDPR requirements:
[paste policy]"
```

## What You Get

### Automated Scans

Claude can use Python tools to scan:
- Data collection patterns (forms, APIs, cookies)
- Database schemas for personal data
- Data subject rights implementation
- Security measures (encryption, auth)

### Reference Materials

Claude has access to 8 comprehensive GDPR references:
- All key GDPR articles
- Personal data categories
- Security requirements
- Legal bases for processing
- And more...

### Professional Reports

Get detailed audit reports with:
- Executive summary
- Risk-prioritized findings
- Specific code references (file:line)
- GDPR article citations
- Actionable recommendations
- Implementation roadmap

## Next Steps

### Explore Features

```
# Ask about specific GDPR topics:
"What are the GDPR requirements for data retention?"
"How should I implement the right to erasure?"
"What security measures does GDPR require?"

# Get implementation help:
"How do I add a consent mechanism to my app?"
"Show me an example of GDPR-compliant data deletion"
```

### Run Scanning Tools Manually

```bash
# Scan for data collection
python scripts/scan_data_collection.py /path/to/code

# Analyze database
python scripts/analyze_database_schema.py /path/to/schema.sql

# Check security
python scripts/security_audit.py /path/to/app
```

### Customize for Your Needs

- Edit reference materials in `references/`
- Add custom scanning patterns to scripts
- Create your own audit templates

## Troubleshooting

### Skill Doesn't Load

```bash
# Verify installation
ls -la ~/.claude/skills/gdpr-auditor/SKILL.md

# If missing, reinstall:
cd ~/.claude/skills/
rm -rf gdpr-auditor
ln -s ClaudeSkillCollection/gdpr-auditor ./gdpr-auditor

# Restart Claude Code completely
```

### Python Scripts Don't Run

```bash
# Fix permissions
chmod +x ~/.claude/skills/gdpr-auditor/scripts/*.py

# Test manually
python3 ~/.claude/skills/gdpr-auditor/scripts/scan_data_collection.py --help
```

## Tips for Best Results

### 1. Be Specific

Instead of: "Audit my app"

Try: "Audit my FastAPI application at /path/to/app, focusing on user authentication, file uploads, and database schema"

### 2. Provide Context

```
"I'm building a SaaS platform that processes user documents.
Please audit for GDPR compliance, especially data retention
and cross-border transfers."
```

### 3. Ask for Specific Areas

```
"Review my implementation of data subject rights:
[paste relevant code]

Do I meet GDPR Articles 15-22 requirements?"
```

### 4. Use for Learning

```
"Explain GDPR's data minimization principle with examples
from my codebase at /path/to/app"
```

## Example Workflow

### Complete Application Audit

1. **Initial Scan**
   ```
   "Scan /path/to/app for GDPR compliance issues"
   ```

2. **Deep Dive on Findings**
   ```
   "You found missing consent - show me how to implement
   GDPR-compliant consent for file uploads"
   ```

3. **Verify Fix**
   ```
   "Review this consent implementation:
   [paste code]

   Does it meet GDPR Article 7 requirements?"
   ```

4. **Generate Report**
   ```
   "Generate a complete GDPR audit report for this project
   with all findings, recommendations, and a compliance roadmap"
   ```
